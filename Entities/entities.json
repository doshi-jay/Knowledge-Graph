V upravnih postopkih \u0161e vedno lahko sodelujejo nevladne organizacije in vse druge stranke, ki jih ukrepi zadevajo. \u010ce pobudnice niso zmo\u017ene poenotiti svojih stali\u0161\u010d in skupaj nastopati v postopku izdaje gradbenega dovoljenja, to \u0161e ne pomeni, da je izdano gradbeno dovoljenje nezakonito ali da bodo nastale te\u017eko popravljive posledice za okolje. Upravni postopki ne bi smeli biti poligon za uresni\u010devanje parcialnih interesov posameznih nevladnih organizacij. Prav tako se nevladne organizacije ne vklju\u010dijo v izdajo vseh gradbenih dovoljenj, pa to \u0161e ne pomeni, da so ta gradbena dovoljenja zato nezakonita oziroma da je za okolje nastala \u0161koda. Nevladne organizacije imajo \u0161e vedno mo\u017enost uveljavitve pravnega varstva, njihova pravna sredstva pa se bodo prednostno obravnavala, tako da kljub izvr\u0161evanju ZIUZEOP na okolju ne bo nastala okoljska \u0161koda. Poleg tega iz Aarhu\u0161ke konvencije ne izhaja, da mora imeti dostop do pravnega varstva vsaka nevladna organizacija, temve\u010d zgolj tista, ki zastopa vklju\u010deno javnost.\n\nNa drugi strani si dr\u017eava prizadeva s sprejetimi ukrepi o\u017eiviti gospodarstvo in v ta namen postopke za pridobitev gradbenega dovoljenja, ki je prvi pogoj za izvedbo investicije, narediti u\u010dinkovitej\u0161e.

Professional fees in Canada increased by $30,609 mostly due to an increase in audit fees.\n\nMarketing and promotion of $32,459 in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $70,282) declined due to less trade shows and travel mostly related to the Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nFiling and transfer agent fees of $27,850 in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $11,050) increased due to the increase in filing fees related to the increase in outstanding shares and market capitalization.\n\nOther general and administrative expenses of $70,539 in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $73,883) include $44,662 (Q1 2019: $61,873) related to operations in Brazil, and $25,877 (Q1 2019: $12,010) related to operations in Canada.\n\nStock-based compensation of $nil in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $48,111).

The Q1 2019 stock compensation relates to unvested options granted in 2018.\n\nForeign exchange gain of $166,311 (Q1 2019: $15,864) was due mostly to the DNPM liability that is recorded in Brazilian reals. The decline in the value of the Brazilian reals relative to the Canadian dollar in Q1 2020 accounted for most of this foreign exchange gain.\n\nInterest and finance charges of $21,550 (Q1 2019: $1,724) relate mostly to the accrual of interest on the DNPM liability.\n\nAbout Amarillo\n\nAmarillo Gold Corporation (www.amarillogold.com) is advancing two gold projects in Brazil. Both are in mining-friendly states and have excellent nearby infrastructure.\n\nThe development stage Posse Gold Project on its Mara Rosa Property in Goi\u00e1s State has received the main permit that provides social and environmental permission for mining.

The listing follows similar moves by Champignon Brands and MindMed in March and Psyched Wellness last week.\n\nRed Light Holland is headed by CEO and former radio and SiriusXM shock jock Todd Shapiro, who combined his passion for capital markets and contacts he's made in the media industry to launch the firm. Although he had experimented with psilocybin mushrooms a few times in college, Shapiro readily admits he is in no way a pioneer or longtime advocate in the field of psychedelics. But when a suicide in his family left him badly shaken, he began to look at magic mushrooms in a new light.\n\nShapiro's media career had been based on research and taking deep dives into the issues of the day, so when he learned about studies that revealed psilocybin's potential as a treatment for depression, anxiety, and PTSD, he was intrigued. And when psychedelic mushrooms helped him with his personal struggles, he was inspired.\n\n\"I started to think about how I can try to make a difference in this world beyond my radio show,\" Shapiro said in a phone interview with High Times.\n\nAfter learning that psilocybin truffles (which like their culinary cousins are underground clumps of fungi that send up mushrooms under favorable conditions) are legal in the Netherlands, Shapiro began developing a plan to bring the wellness benefits of psychedelics to the public. By bringing together the contacts he had made at work and while learning about capital markets, which included investors in Canada's cannabis industry, before long he had raised $4 million dollars to get Red Light Holland off the ground.\n\n\"I pitched to people a story of passion and of love,\" Shapiro explained. \"I did it wearing a ball cap and Air Jordans. I'm not a typical finance guy, other than the fact that I just like to study the markets and found them intriguing.\"\n\nAlthough he is careful not to make any medical claims that haven't yet been proven, Shapiro notes that anecdotal evidence and his own experience show that psilocybin can help with achieving clarity, focus, and mental wellness. Red Light Holland plans to share that potential by initially offering microdosed psilocybin truffle products for the recreational market in Holland. And as research in the field continues, Red Light hopes to develop truffles that pass muster as bona fide medical-grade therapeutics.\n\n\"I want to be able to, hopefully, prove out, with a great team of people with me and in this newly emerging sector, that psilocybin in the truffle can actually help people,\" Shapiro said.\n\nThat team includes popular Canadian comedian Russell Peters as chief creative officer and Canopy Growth founder and former-CEO Bruce Linton, who also has a stake in MindMed. Linton, who has signed on as chairman of Red Light Holland's advisory board, will use his experience with tightly regulated substances and emerging markets to help guide the company's path forward.\n\n\"Red Light Holland's progress to date, including its receipt of approval to list on the CSE, is another example of the strong leadership I am proud to back,\" Linton said in a press release. \"As an early investor in Todd's vision, and Red Light Holland, I am looking forward to mentoring Todd and advising his strong team in this emerging psychedelic space.\"\n\nAs Shapiro builds the new brand and the team behind it, the new access to capital afforded by Red Light Holland's stock market listing will allow the company to establish its infrastructure and grow into new markets. With the laws of Brazil, Bulgaria, and Jamaica also seemingly conducive to a market for psilocybin products, the company sees the potential for expansion. But any growth, Shapiro noted, will be deliberate rather than hasty.\n\n\"When you grow too big too quick you typically fail because people are burning through too much money,\" he said. \"We want to do this carefully and we want to do it methodically.\"\n\nPart of that strategy involves educating the public about the advances in psychedelics to share the growing body of knowledge in the field. Those outreach efforts include a robust marketing plan and a new psychedelics podcast from Red Light Holland in partnership with High Times that launches next week.\n\nThe success of Red Light Holland's Thursday debut on the CSE under the ticker symbol TRIP, which saw more than 15 million shares of the new company change hands, isn't going to Shapiro's head. In fact, he's hoping for a nascent industry that sees more cooperation than competition, as veteran advocates of psychedelics and companies working to make them more accessible come together.\n\n\"We're very grateful for the leg work that they've done, and we would like to think that we can work together with everybody because the whole point of psilocybin is really to connect and to have no ego,\" Shapiro explained.", "uri": "6085327266", "url": "https://hightimes.com/business/magic-truffles-get-stock-market-listing/"}], "6085327267": [589581467, {"sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:39:00Z", "name": "Govt to ensure firms don't get picked up at throwaway prices: FM", "dtype": "news", "pk": 589581467, "text": "New Delhi, May 29 (PTI) The threat of hostile takeovers is certainly a worry and the government will ensure that Indian businesses do not get snapped up at throwaway prices, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has hit industries across the world due to depressed demand caused by lockdowns.\n\nSo, the market provides opportunities to players with deep pockets to buy companies in distress at a very cheap valuation, she said.\n\n'That's a reality but we have to take care that businesses which have been built by the sweat and toil of Indians, and which have had great brand value, cannot be allowed to be picked up by people who are just looking for an opportunity.\n\n'So, that is a factor which all of us are worried about and that's a factor on which we will certainly do something to ensure that Indian industries don't get picked up at a throwaway price because we want them to be able to run the business once everything is normal,' Sitharaman told television channel WION in an interview.\n\nLast month, the government decided to put restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) to clamp down on investors from countries like China buying Indian companies cheap.\n\nThe amendments to the FDI rules were necessitated on concerns among officials as well as businesses about possible takeover attempts at a time when share prices are down due to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEarlier on Friday, a finance ministry official said the government has not taken a call on putting curbs on foreign portfolio investment (FPI) from China.\n\nOn the GDP growth figure for the March quarter, the finance minister said, '3.1 per cent for the last quarter of 2019-20, a quarter in which we thought we had started seeing green shoots, in September, October, November. That is one of the reasons why the budgetary estimates were made the way they were made.' She said with the full support of the Prime Minister, the government will ensure everyone gets the required help.\n\nIndia's economic growth slowed to 3.1 per cent in January-March and to an 11-year low of 4.2 per cent for the full fiscal 2019-20.\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth stood at 5.7 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018-19, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Friday.\n\nDuring 2019-20, the Indian economy grew at 4.2 per cent as against 6.1 per cent in 2018-19. The economic growth was the lowest since 2008-09 when the economy had expanded at 3.1 per cent.\n\nThe government had imposed a lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 infections from March 25, 2020. However, the Indian economy also got impacted during the January-March quarter due slowing down of economic activities across the world.

Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund and Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte also increased their holdings, they said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.\n\nFink's extensive network in the Middle East was also on display, with at least four state investment vehicles from the region snaring a part of the stake sale. Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co., the Kuwait Investment Authority, Qatar Investment Authority and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund all took part in the offering, according to the people.\n\nThe BlackRock co-founder has been a regular speaker at events organized by Saudi Arabia's wealth fund. In April last year, Fink appeared at a Riyadh conference alongside the finance ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain. Two months earlier, he was in Abu Dhabi for a meeting with ruler Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and signed a deal to invest in the emirate's oil infrastructure\n\nShares of BlackRock closed Wednesday at $536.40 apiece, giving the company a market value of about $82 billion. That means investors who bought from PNC earned a 27% return in about two weeks.\n\nA representative for KIA couldn't be reached for comment. Spokespeople for BlackRock, PNC and the investors declined to comment. The names of the individual investors in the share sale haven't been disclosed yet and will only come out in later filings.\n\nQuick Sale\n\nPNC's sale is the second-largest secondary offering of a U.S. company on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The strong interest from these deep-pocketed investors helped PNC close the deal quickly. The U.S. lender was able to sell the stock within four days of telling BlackRock about its plans, Fink said during a live-streamed interview on May 14.\n\nThe sale marked the end of a 25-year-plus relationship between PNC and the world's largest asset manager. Pittsburgh-based PNC invested $240 million in 1994 when BlackRock was a six-year-old firm. The asset manager went public five years later at $14 a share.\n\nThe idea of PNC selling out of BlackRock was batted around the financial services industry for years. The size of the stake had been flagged as a point of risk in the U.S. Federal Reserve's stress tests, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nInvestment banks had been pitching for a role on the deal for at least a decade, the people said. When the underwriters -- Morgan Stanley, Evercore Inc. and Citigroup Inc. -- received a phone call from PNC's management in early May informing them of the plans to sell, it was a long time coming. The timing made sense as companies around the world were looking to shore up balance sheets amid the Covid-19 pandemic.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:45:00Z", "uri": "6085325476",

Guvamatanga splashes US$50 000 on kitchen suite makeover | Zimbabwe News", "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "text": "UNDERFIRE Ministry of Finance and Economic Development secretary George Guvamatanga has splashed a whooping US$50 000 on a kitchen suite makeover at his Harare house, Zim Morning Post can reveal.\n\nZim Morning Post understands that the transaction was made a few weeks before the Covid-19 induced national lockdown.\n\nThis publication has it on good authority that Guvamatanga made the purchase of the expensive kitchen suite at Tusilago Kitchens, located along Seke Road in Harare.\n\nThe place is known for top notch kitchen make-overs that even attracted the late MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai who also bought an almost similar suite for his then fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth Macheka in 2012.\n\nTsvangirai's suite cost US$40 000.\n\nTrusted sources told this publication that the exclusive suite is within the Memphis Cherry family , and is one of the most expensive brands sold by Tusilago.\n\nIt comes with lots of extras giving rise to more hidden costs.\n\n\"Mdara Guvaz(Guvamatanga) bought a suite almost the same as that Tsvangirai suite that made headlines, and it's in fact better because it carries more extras,\" explained our source who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\nGuvamatanga's position renders him the most powerful civil servant in the finance ministry and on Wednesday he was under fire for approving a dubious US$1 million COVID-19 emergency supplies to a company known as Drax International.\n\nHe has since leapt to his defence arguing that he only sanctioned the release of test kits which were of emergency need.\n\nThe latest buy has compelled some political commentators to blast his extravagance in relation to public office and state of the economy.\n\n\"This man is the bearer of the national purse and his ministry complains of liquidity crunch everyday and preach the gospel of austerity measures ,but his behaviour is completely the opposite.\n\n\"It's shocking and he has failed the morality test and gave rise to suspicion of abuse of funds by top government officials,\" said a political lecturer with a local university.\n\nHowever, some critics shared different sentiments saying Guvamatanga is a free citizen with freedom of choice to buy what he wishes as long as the transaction is within the confines of the law.\n\n\"Guvamatanga can buy whatever he wants and he must exercise his democratic rights.\n\n\"Are you aware the man has been at the helm of Barclays Bank for close to a decade after joining the same bank at the age of 17.\n\n\"He has the bragging rights to celebrate his success with fine things in life,he worked for the monies and I support him,\" said a South Africa based political analyst who declined to be named.\n\n\"Guvamatanga is a businessman and before the President (Mnangagwa) appointed him as perm sec ,four hours after an informal interview ,he was pursuing family businesses including a thriving real estate concern.\n\n\"So US$50 000 is change to him.\n\n\"At one time he wanted to buy large stake in Barclays Bank ,what about a kitchen suite,lets not be petty the country has more pressing issues than kitchens,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Zimstats, the poverty datum line stands slightly above ZWL6 000 with the lowest paid worked getting at least ZWL 1000 which equates go about US$60 on the parallel market.\n\nEfforts to get a comment from Guvamatanga drew a blank as his mobile phone was not reachable at the time of writing.\n\nHe had not responded to SMS and Whats app messages sent to him despite the later registering confirmation of receipt through blue ticks, while authorities at Tusilago cited client confidentiality and remained mum over the transaction.\n\nHowever, in telephonic conversations listened to by this reporter via third party, Guvamatanga confirmed the big buy citing that there was nothing sinister and he even plans to make a better purchase.-zimmorningpost", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-29T16:22:00Z", "uri": "6085325083", "url":

D\u00e9confinement : Emmanuel Macron assure les maires de l'\u00e9coute et du soutien de l'\u00c9tat\n\nCette enveloppe, qui sera contenue dans le 3 projet de loi de finances rectificative attendu mi-juin, permet d'\u00e9ponger une partie des pertes engendr\u00e9es par l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie de coronavirus et \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 hauteur de 3,2 milliards d'euros pour 2020 pour les communes et intercommunalit\u00e9s.\n\nL'enveloppe sera calcul\u00e9e au cas par cas, par rapport \u00e0 une moyenne des recettes des trois derniers exercices, a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le premier ministre, \u00e0 l'issue d'une r\u00e9union avec les repr\u00e9sentants des associations de maires \u00e0 Matignon.\n\nCette mesure vise \u00e0 compenser des pertes de recettes fiscales comme la cotisation fonci\u00e8re des entreprises, les taxes de s\u00e9jour ou les recettes de stationnement. Certaines stations touristiques sont particuli\u00e8rement impact\u00e9es. Mais elle ne prend pas en compte les autres recettes tarifaires, comme la restauration scolaire, les cr\u00e8ches ou les piscines.\n\nSur ce point, l'\u00e9tat des lieux reste encore \u00e0 \u00e9tablir. Des \u00e9lus locaux reconnaissent que les services municipaux \u00e9tant rarement b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, leur interruption li\u00e9e au confinement n'affecte pas forc\u00e9ment leurs finances.\n\nLe gouvernement a \u00e9galement annonc\u00e9 que des d\u00e9penses li\u00e9es au coronavirus, comme l'achat de masques, seraient isol\u00e9es dans une annexe sp\u00e9cifique dans les budgets des communes, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que cela ne gr\u00e8ve pas leur budget de fonctionnement. Les communes demandaient que ces d\u00e9penses soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des d\u00e9penses d'investissement.\n\nEnfin, le chef du gouvernement a \u00e9galement annonc\u00e9 qu'il allait doter \" d'un milliard d'euros suppl\u00e9mentaires \" la dotation de soutien \u00e0 l'investissement local. Ce fond de 600 millions sert \u00e0 accompagner certains investissements des communes li\u00e9s notamment \u00e0 la transition \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique. \" C'est l\u00e0 aussi un montant jamais vu, massif et \u00e7a doit produire un effet rapide dans les finances et dans les investissements de nos collectivit\u00e9s territoriales \", a insist\u00e9 \u00c9douard Philippe.\n\nLe premier ministre, en recevant les repr\u00e9sentants des d\u00e9partements vendredi apr\u00e8s midi, devait leur annoncer des mesures de soutien car certaines recettes comme les droits sur les transactions immobili\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9es. Les d\u00e9partements, en charge de l'aide sociale, vont aussi devoir faire face \u00e0 une forte augmentation des prestations li\u00e9es au contexte de crise.\n\nAlors que ces r\u00e9unions se tenaient \u00e0 Matignon, les pr\u00e9sidents des r\u00e9gions de France re\u00e7us au minist\u00e8re des finances dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9paration du futur plan de relance, ont claqu\u00e9 la porte, furieux d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \" exclus \" des aides du gouvernement.\n\n\" Qui peut croire une seconde que l'\u00c9tat r\u00e9ussira la relance et parviendra \u00e0 reconstruire le pays sans les R\u00e9gions, chefs de file de l'\u00e9conomie dans les territoires ? \", demande l'association R\u00e9gions de France, qui appelle \" le premier ministre \u00e0 clarifier tr\u00e8s rapidement la position du gouvernement \".\n\nDe source proche du dossier, on insiste sur le fait que les r\u00e9gions qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d'importantes ressources ne sont pas impact\u00e9es de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re par la crise. Leurs pertes de recettes fiscales, \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 environ 900 millions d'euros (TVA, taxe int\u00e9rieure de consommation sur les produits \u00e9nerg\u00e9tiques) feront l'objet de discussion dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9paration de la loi de finance 2021.\n\nL'annonce de l'ex\u00e9cutif et la r\u00e9action des r\u00e9gions sont toutefois r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices du mauvais climat depuis le d\u00e9but de la crise. Le gouvernement n'a pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le r\u00f4le de certains pr\u00e9sidents de r\u00e9gions qui l'ont attaqu\u00e9 sur la gestion des masques et se sont pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9s pour en acheter des millions et le faire savoir \u00e0 grand renfort de communication.

The scene turned into something straight out of a movie when a pair of gangsters clandestinely attempted to kidnap local rapper Anuel AA. After a brief scuffle and flagrant shouting match, however, the man born Emmanuel Gazmey Santiago went on to finish the evening's holiday spree in the boisterous company of his loyal posse.\n\nMonths later, after ushering in the new year on a promising note by featuring on one of Latin trap's first global hits - De La Ghetto's sex anthem \"La Ocasion\" with Arcangel and Ozuna - someone delivered Anuel AA a divine premonition of sorts: \"If you keep talking about this stuff in your songs, something really ugly is going to happen to you.\"\n\nA Puerto Rican music legend, Hector \"El Father\" of reggaeton-turned-son of God, paid Anuel a visit to share his foreboding message. \"He and I did not know each other,\" explained Anuel, who prides himself on waxing poetics about the real-life experiences Hector was concerned with, \"but God spoke to him and Hector felt he needed to reach out to me. When he warned me, he said it with so much conviction that he even cried.\"\n\nHaving forged a legacy of his own as one of the key trailblazing reggaeton entertainers of the '90s who later signed a deal with JAY-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records, Hector - now a devoted Christian - understood life imitated art when it came to Anuel's lyrics.\n\n\"My lyrics talked a lot about God and the devil, so when he told me that,\" Anuel continued, \"I knew I needed to make some changes. Those themes, good versus evil, they were my mark and what separated me from the rest.\"\n\nOn April 3, 2016, just two weeks after meeting with Hector, Anuel was arrested and held in Guaynabo's correctional institution on charges of illegal gun possession. Following his biggest musical break yet, just as he was touching the cusp of international stardom, a court judge sentenced Anuel to 30 months in federal prison without bail.\n\nRaised east of San Juan, in the Puerto Rican city of Carolina, Anuel AA has a lot in common with many of my favorite MCs: he's charming, resolute, and lyrically gifted, yet marred by a criminal past, complicit misogyny and the constant struggle between right and wrong. \"I had no choice but to carry those weapons with me, because of the issues I had on the street,\" the rapper said to VIBE Viva over the phone, while quarantined in Miami. \"I thought to myself I'd rather be locked up than found dead.\"\n\nIndeed, Anuel had evaded his probable demise when he was nearly abducted and landed right behind bars months later, fulfilling a prophecy that cost him both his freedom and a flourishing start at the tipping point of trap music en Espa\u00f1ol. \"I was being forced to reckon with all the bad things I had done for money in the past,\" Anuel expressed, regretfully. \"I started reading the Bible for the first time and realized that my talent and blessings came from God, not anywhere else.\"\n\nAnuel had begun to take music seriously around the same time his father, Jos\u00e9 Gazmey, was laid off from his coveted A&R position at Sony Music. With his back against the wall, a scrappy Anuel left home at 15 and began to engage in felonious activity to help provide for his family and finance his music endeavors.\n\nLike many rappers on the island, Anuel was influenced by popular culture and trends on the mainland, most discernibly by contemporary trap. Anuel understood the genre's synonymy with street life and the drug enterprise and immediately took to Messiah El Artista, a Dominican-American rapper VIBE profiled for championing Spanish-language trap music all over New York.\n\n\"I figured if Latin trap was doing well in New York, it was for sure going to pop in Puerto Rico,\" said Anuel, who had signed with the Latino division of Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group the year prior to his arrest. \"I spent about a month in New York before I returned to Puerto Rico. Then I started to release all the songs I had, one by one, and they began to gain popularity.\"\n\nWhile artists like J. Balvin helped breathe new life into the reggaeton genre in Colombia, Anuel wanted to spearhead a movement in Puerto Rico with a sound all their own. \"I recorded the 'Esclava' remix with Bryant Myers and it might not have taken off worldwide, but it became a huge trap song in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nAkin to the heydays of reggaeton, an Afro-Caribbean genre-fusing hip-hop and reggae that originated in Puerto Rico, trap music was considered lowbrow and was heavily criticized for its vulgarity, violence, and explicit lyrics. Puerto Rican critics and artists alike had very little faith in the music's potential and therefore denounced it. \"DJ Luian, who is like a brother to me, couldn't understand why I wanted to put all my energy into music that none of our artists wanted to sing.\"\n\n\"Reggaeton went dormant for years,\" he continued. \"It was necessary to make trap music, because it felt like reggaeton was stuck in another era.\" A self-described student of the late and oft-controversial Tupac Shakur, Anuel thought reggaeton had reached its pinnacle and believed Latin trap would be its successor.\n\nSongs like \"Nunca Sapo,\" where Anuel channels Rick Ross' Teflon Don ethos and spits a grimy slow-tempo flow over a sinister 808-laden instrumental, helped put a face to Anuel's little-known name in the US. On cuts like Farruko's \"Liberace,\" Anuel speeds up his delivery for fun and plays on the \"Versace\" rhythm popularized by Migos, who all hail from Atlanta -- the widely credited birthplace of trap music.\n\nFor Anuel, whose life mantra \"real hasta la muerte\" is now a famous hashtag, music aspirations had little to do with radio play. Anuel, 27, was largely concerned with dominating the digital space, especially while incarcerated. Despite his arrest, he continued to release music from behind prison walls while his team fed his massive following up-to-date content.\n\nHear This Music CEO, DJ Luian heeded what Anuel was trying to accomplish and began to work with Bad Bunny, the Latin Grammy-winning artist and star voice of the current Latin trap movement. \"When I was locked up, Luian helped develop Bad Bunny and he basically became in charge of keeping trap alive while I was away,\" said Anuel, who ironically came under fire recently and was accused of throwing shade at Bad Bunny for the video treatment of \"Yo Perreo Sola,\" in which the rapper-singer dresses in drag as a stance against toxic masculinity.\n\n\"I couldn't believe something like this was going viral,\" Anuel interrupted anxiously before I could expound on a question concerning their relationship. \"It looked like it was something that was edited or put together to make my Instagram posts read that way. I immediately texted Bad Bunny about it and he was like, 'Don't worry, people are always going to be talking sh*t.'\"\n\nAnuel considers Bad Bunny a genius at what he does and maintains that despite not knowing each other very well, he and his fellow compatriot are friendly collaborators with a working rapport: \"When he and I do a new song together, what will people say then?\"\n\nToday, the collective jury will reach a verdict upon listening to Anuel's newly-released sophomore studio album Emmanuel, where fans will find a track titled \"Hasta Que Dios Diga,\" a sultry, mid-tempo reggaeton number. Fans can expect to hear a star-studded project riddled with guest features, including Tego Calder\u00f3n, Daddy Yankee, Enrique Iglesias, J. Balvin, Ozuna, and Karol G, to name a few.\n\nDiscussing life during a global pandemic, Anuel spoke fondly of his partner-in-rhyme, Colombian singer-songwriter Karol G. \"She's the love of my life. She's been there with me through the good and bad. People who really love you are the ones who stand firm by you when things are bleak. In my toughest moments, Karol was there. She's shown me how to be a better man,\" he gushed.\n\n\"Karol comes off as super feminine -- which she is, but Karol also has a really tough masculine side,\" Anuel laughed heartily on the other end of the line. \"She rides motorcycles and likes taking them up these crazy hills. She rides jet skis too! She's like a dude, haha. We work well together and we give each other advice all the time.\"\n\nThe pair are making the most of quarantine life in South Florida, releasing a self-directed and self-shot music video for their joint single \"Follow,\" a reference to flirting over social media in the era of social-distancing, the idea that shooting one's proverbial shot can lead to a budding romance.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Anuel dropped his debut studio album, Real Hasta La Muerte, hours before he was released from jail. By September, the RIAA certified his introduction to the game platinum, garnering the attention of Roc Nation artist Meek Mill. When the Philly wordsmith released his fourth studio LP in November of the same year, followers were geeked to learn Anuel had earned himself a place on Meek's highly anticipated Championships album with \"Uptown Vibes.\"\n\n\"Recording with Meek Mill for me was like when Allen Iverson played with Michael Jordan for the first time,\" Anuel said, singing praises about their first-ever partnership. \"I'm a huge fan of Meek; when his music took off I was still in the streets, so I related and identified with a lot of the things he was saying.\"\n\n\"Meek doesn't understand a lick of Spanish,\" he mused in jest, \"but he's always with a bunch of Latinos. When I speak to him he says, 'I don't know what you're saying, but my Spanish [speaking] ni**as tell me you be talking that sh*t!'\"\n\nAnuel leveraged his knack for storytelling and released \"3 de Abril\" earlier this year, an emotional freestyle about the day he was arrested and a graphic snapshot of his trials and tribulations.\n\n\"I did things without caring about the consequences. I thought I was a man because I was street smart. Now I know what it's like to lose everything, so I wanted to talk more about my life and the experiences of me and my family,\" Anuel described the inspiration behind the song.\n\nFollowing the release of \"3 de Abril,\" Anuel again turned hip-hop heads when he and Lil Pump shared a fiery audiovisual for their collaborative effort \"Illuminati,\" stamping Pump's first new song since summer 2019. This year, Anuel also has songs with Colombian pop empress Shakira (\"Me Gusta\") and with the late Juice WRLD (\"No Me Ames\").\n\nAlbeit Anuel and Juice WRLD never got to meet in person, Anuel learned about the Chicago rapper from listening to his singles on the radio in jail. \"The same year I won Billboard Latin's Artist of The Year award, Juice WRLD won New Artist at the American Billboard Awards. We ended up recording the song after that but held off on releasing it for a bit because he and I had respective singles coming out at the same time,\" Anuel explained.\n\n\"By the time we were finally ready to premiere it, Juice WRLD had passed away. We were never able to record together in person, but at least we got to feature him on the video. I know the tribute gave his fans and family some needed strength.\"\n\nLess than 30 minutes have gone by and already I am forced to wrap my conversation with Boricua's burgeoning superstar:\n\nAnuel, explain \"real hasta la muerte\" for me. Why exactly is this mantra of yours so important?\n\n\"I can't betray anyone. I don't know what it's like to really betray someone. I'm very loyal to my circle, my family, and those I hold close to me. Being real is what keeps me humble. It doesn't matter how much money I make or how much I accomplish. What's critical is staying real to myself and keeping my feet on the ground. That's what helps keep me going.\"\n\n--", "uri": "6085324620", "url": "https://www.vibe.com/featured/anuel-aa-vibe-viva-cover-story"}], "6085323218": [933543433, {"sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:31:00Z", "name": "Preserving Donor Privacy in North Carolina - John Locke Foundation", "dtype": "news", "pk": 933543433, "text": "Donor privacy protects our expressive rights, especially with regard to matters of public policy. Unfortunately, entrenched political interests have often successfully undermined that protection by forcing policy and advocacy organizations to disclose the names of their supporters. To preserve our right to free expression, we must resist these attacks on donor privacy by supporting organizations that are challenging donor disclosure demands in court, by opposing laws and administrative orders that require donor disclosure, and by encouraging the enactment of laws that affirmatively protect donor privacy.\n\nFreedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances: these are vitally important, fundamental rights that protect our ability to express ourselves freely, especially on matters of public policy. All four are essential for the operation of our republican system of government and for the survival of our free society. And all four are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and by the constitutions of most states, including North Carolina.\n\nRegulations that force nonprofits to disclose the names of their donors make people afraid to exercise these rights. That is why entrenched political interests favor such regulations, and that is why the rest of us must vigorously oppose them.\n\nWe can, of course, exercise our expressive rights in person by speaking in public, by publishing our printed thoughts on paper or online, by attending meetings with other like-minded people, and by writing to and calling on our elected representatives. For most of us, however, it is far more efficient and effective to join with others in support of nonprofit organizations that speak and publish and advocate on our behalf. The staff of such organizations can devote more time and expertise to expressing our views than we can, and, if a sufficient number of like-minded people are willing to join in their support, such organizations can express our views more forcefully and broadcast them more widely than we can possibly do on our own.\n\nUnfortunately, in recent years, elected officials and advocacy organizations in many states have been imposing donor disclosure requirements that discourage people from expressing themselves in this highly effective way. There are many reasons why donors may wish to remain anonymous. The threat of disclosure will, to some extent, discourage donations to every kind of nonprofit organization. However, when it comes to public policy and advocacy organizations, the impact of donor disclosure requirements varies greatly depending on whether the organization represents donors who espouse conventional or alternative views on contentious issues. Donors who espouse conventional views have little to fear from disclosure, and most of them will continue to support organizations that help them express those views even if they lose the ability to do so anonymously. For donors who espouse alternative views, on the other hand, the effect of disclosure can be devastating. This includes job losses and death threats for private individuals, boycotts and protests for business owners, and doxxing and online hate-storms for members of both groups. Rather than risk that kind of retaliation, many people will stop contributing to organizations that help them express their alternative views, even though it means giving up their right to express themselves in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nThis differential impact means that even donor disclosure requirements that appear neutral on their face can be deployed effectively to suppress the expression of unpopular views. Entrenched political interests know this, and there is a long and disreputable history of using donor disclosure as a weapon against political and ideological opponents.\n\nIn the 1950s, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was beginning to win major victories in its long struggle to overturn the system of legally enforced racial discrimination in the American South. In the middle of the decade, however, the Democratic establishment in many Southern states began to deploy a new and effective weapon against the civil rights organization: donor disclosure. From Virginia to Florida and from North Carolina to Texas, Democrat-controlled legislatures and Democratic state attorneys began demanding that the NAACP turn over the names of its supporters as a condition for operating within their states. The legislators and attorneys generally assumed that many supporters would withdraw their support for the organization if doing so meant risking reprisals from segregationists, and they were right. In just two years, from 1955 to 1957, NAACP membership declined in Southern states by more than 50 percent.\n\nIn Alabama, the NAACP affiliate fought back. It challenged the state's disclosure requirement in federal court and, in 1958, won a decisive victory. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice John M. Harlan II, the Supreme Court found that Alabama's disclosure law violated the U.S. Constitution:\n\nWe hold that the immunity from state scrutiny of membership lists which the Association claims on behalf of its members is here so related to the right of the members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and to associate freely with others in so doing as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIt was a clear and forceful opinion as far as it went, and it had the effect of discouraging attacks on donor privacy for many years. Unfortunately, it didn't go far enough.\n\nPrivacy advocates frequently cite NAACP v. Alabama in support of the proposition that laws and administrative orders that force nonprofits to disclose the names of their donors violate the U.S. Constitution. However, much as we may wish that were true, the opinion itself provides only a very limited defense of donor privacy. As we will see in Part 4 of this report, the ruling has done very little to deter the political establishment's current use of donor disclosure as a weapon against its political and ideological opponents.\n\nPerhaps the most important reason why NAACP v. Alabama has done so little to deter attacks on donor privacy is the fact that it was an \"as-applied\" rather than a \"facial\" finding. If the court had found that Alabama's disclosure demand was unconstitutional on its face, it would have meant that the law, and all similar laws, were unconstitutional as applied to anyone, regardless of specific circumstances. Instead, the court emphasized the importance of various specific facts about the situation in which the NAACP and its supporters found themselves in Alabama in the 1950s, including that those supporters had already experienced actual harassment and intimidation. Even more importantly, the court explicitly distinguished that situation from the situations in other cases -- cases in which the court had previously upheld donor disclosure demands. All of that left the door open for courts to uphold future disclosure demands as long as the situation facing the plaintiffs in those cases was materially different from the situation facing the NAACP and its supporters in 1958.\n\nNAACP v. Alabama's deterrent effect may also have been limited by the fact that it said very little about the extent to which Alabama's donor disclosure demands made the NAACP's supporters afraid to exercise rights explicitly guaranteed by the text of the First Amendment: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government. Instead, it focused much more on the extent to which those demands violated a right that is never mentioned in the First Amendment or anywhere else in the Constitution -- the right to \"association.\" The court said:\n\nEffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court has more than once recognized. ... It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the \"liberty\" assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech. ...\n\nInviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs. ... [W]e think it apparent that compelled disclosure of petitioner's Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely the ability of petitioner and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate, in that it may induce members to withdraw from the Association and dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure.\n\nIt is certainly true that the court had previously found that a right of association is somehow implicit in the 14th Amendment's protection of due process. Given that finding, it is easy to see why the court might have been pleased to have an opportunity to vindicate that recently discovered right. Nevertheless, the fact that the court focused on this unenumerated right, rather than on rights specifically listed in the Constitution, may account for the court's lack of clarity regarding a vitally important issue: the standard of review.\n\nThere is nothing in the U.S. Constitution to suggest a hierarchy of rights. Over the last 80 years, however, the Supreme Court has developed a \"tiers of scrutiny\" doctrine under which some rights are protected more zealously than others.\n\nAt the lowest level are property rights and rights pertaining to commercial transactions. According to tiers of scrutiny doctrine, a law or administrative order that infringes on those rights \"is not to be pronounced unconstitutional unless ... it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that it rests upon some rational basis.\"\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy are a small number of rights the Supreme Court has singled out for special protection, including some (but for some reason not all) of the rights specifically protected by \"the first ten amendments and those which are deemed equally specific when held to be embraced within the Fourteenth.\" A law or administrative order that infringes on one or more of these rights is subject to \"strict scrutiny,\" which means it will only be allowed to stand if it is \"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\" Also subject to strict scrutiny are: \"[L]egislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation,\" and \"statutes directed at ... discrete and insular minorities.\"\n\nOver the years, \"strict\" scrutiny and \"rational basis\" scrutiny have been supplemented with various intermediate levels of scrutiny, including one called \"exacting\" scrutiny that the court has applied in cases involving campaign finance laws. Generally speaking, to withstand intermediate scrutiny, the government must show that the law or administrative order furthers an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest.\n\nThere were many reasons why the Supreme Court could have applied strict scrutiny in NAACP v. Alabama. As noted previously, the Alabama attorney general's demand for the names of the NAACP's supporters clearly restricted the supporters' ability to exercise several enumerated First Amendment rights for which strict scrutiny protection was usually deemed appropriate, e.g., freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to petition the government. The demand for donors names also clearly restricted the political processes which ordinarily can be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation. Moreover, at one point in the opinion, the court even implied that the right of association might merit the protection afforded by strict scrutiny. The court said, \"[S]tate action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.\" However, when it came time to balance Alabama's justification for demanding the list of donors against the NAACP's supporters' right to association, the court did not apply the strict scrutiny test, which requires a compelling governmental reason and narrow tailoring. Instead, it said, \"Whether there was 'justification' in this instance turns solely on the substantiality of Alabama's interest in obtaining the membership lists,\" which implies that it was applying an intermediate level of scrutiny instead.\n\nThe fact that the Supreme Court was ambivalent about the standard of review it was applying in NAACP v. Alabama, and the fact that it decided the case on an as-applied rather than a facial basis, have provided federal courts with a good deal of flexibility in dealing with subsequent donor disclosure cases. They have found it easy to distinguish the situation faced by plaintiffs in more recent cases from the situation of the NAACP and its supporters in Alabama in 1958. And, when they have undertaken the inevitably subjective task of balancing the government's professed reasons for wanting to know the names of nonprofits' donors against the donors' desire for and right to privacy, they have found it easy to conclude that the former outweighs the latter.\n\nIn New York and California, the state attorneys general opened the attack on donor privacy by promulgating rules requiring nonprofits to submit copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 990, including Schedule B, which lists donors' names and addresses. The IRS collects this information for comparison with charitable deductions claimed by taxpayers, and it keeps the information strictly confidential.\n\nKnowing that many of their donors prefer to contribute anonymously, nonprofits in both states initially complied with the new rules by submitting Schedule Bs with the names and addresses of their donors redacted. In 2013, however, New York's Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, began serving deficiency notices on nonprofits that submitted redacted Schedule Bs. The following year, California Attorney General Kamala Harris started to do the same thing.\n\nIn New York, two affiliated nonprofits, Citizens United and the Citizens United Foundation, filed a joint lawsuit challenging Schneiderman's enforcement action in federal court. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where it was dismissed. Writing for the three-judge panel, Judge Rosemary S. Pooler had no trouble explaining why the precedents established by NAACP v. Alabama left her free to reach a different result.\n\nShe rejected the plaintiffs' request for strict scrutiny, declaring, \"We will apply exacting scrutiny, then, which requires a 'substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest.'\" Then she went on to apply that test to the circumstances in the case before her, noting as she did so, that the differences between those circumstances and the ones that applied in NAACP v. Alabama justified her decision to reach a different result:\n\nIn NAACP, the Court was presented ... with \"an uncontroverted showing that on past occasions revelation of the identity of its rank\u2010and\u2010file members has exposed those members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, [and] threat of physical coercion,\" and it was well known at the time that civil rights activists in Alabama and elsewhere had been beaten and/or killed. The speech chilling likely to result from these harrowing and near\u2010certain threats of harm easily outweighed the state's asserted interest in preventing out\u2010of\u2010state corporations from conducting in\u2010state business. ...\n\nIn this case, all we have to go on is a bare assertion that the Attorney General has a vendetta against [the plaintiffs]. ... That is a far cry from the clear and present danger that white supremacist vigilantes and their abettors in the Alabama state government presented to members of the NAACP in the 1950s.\n\nMeanwhile, and unlike the Court in NAACP, we have already concluded that the Attorney General's regulations are substantially related to the important interest in keeping nonprofit organizations honest. Our balancing task is easy. We have no problem concluding that the regulations in front of us do not impermissibly chill the speech of Appellants or their donors.\n\nIn California, events unfolded in a similar way. Three unaffiliated nonprofits -- Americans for Prosperity, the Institute for Free Speech (known at the time as the Center for Competitive Politics), and the Thomas More Law Center -- filed separate lawsuits challenging the enforcement actions initiated by Attorney General Harris. In all three cases, when the challenge reached the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the attorney general's demand should be reviewed under the strict scrutiny standard, found that the state had met its burden under the less rigorous \"exacting scrutiny\" standard, and eventually decided the case in favor of the state attorney general.\n\nThe news for donor privacy advocates has not been all bad. Working with his allies in the state legislature, in 2016, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo led an effort to use donor disclosure as a weapon against those who opposed his policies and the policies of New York's Democratic establishment. In the early hours of the morning on June 17, 2016, with only a few minutes of discussion in either chamber and without the three days notice normally required under the New York Constitution, the New York legislature approved a new \"ethics law\" that would, according to Cuomo, \"shed light on the dark money that runs rampant through our political process.\"\n\nIn fact, the law's disclosure requirements applied to a wide range of nonprofits, all of which were already heavily regulated in ways that prevented any of them from improperly trying to influence the outcome of elections. What the law actually did was give the political establishment a weapon it could use to suppress expressive freedom. What made that weapon particularly powerful was the requirement that \"disclosure reports be forwarded to a joint commission on public ethics for the purpose of publishing such reports on the commission's website.\"\n\nThe donor disclosure requirements in the new ethics law were immediately challenged by a coalition of plaintiffs that was led by the Citizens Union of the City of New York, and that included the American Civil Liberties Union as well as several other civil liberties advocacy groups. Last year, the donor disclosure requirements were summarily struck down in an exceptionally well-researched and well-reasoned opinion by Judge Denise Cote for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. As a lower court judge, Judge Cote was bound by the Second Circuit's holding that donor disclosure demands are subject to exacting, rather than strict, scrutiny. Nevertheless, she found that New York's new disclosure law, including, in particular, its public disclosure provisions, woefully failed to satisfy even that lower level of scrutiny, and she declared that is was \"facially invalid.\"\n\nThe State of New York has appealed the case. The appeal will be heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the same court that upheld Eric Schneiderman's demand for donor lists. However, there are differences between the two cases that should give donor rights advocates hope. The administrative disclosure rules that were challenged in Citizens United v. Schneiderman were ostensibly promulgated for law enforcement purposes. The attorney general was able to argue, with some degree of plausibility, that the names disclosed would not be made available to the public. Given what we know about state governments and their databases, that sort of promise probably does little to reassure potential donors. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit included it in its list of reasons for upholding the order. The new ethics law, on the other hand, was enacted for the specific purpose of making donors names available to the public. Gov. Cuomo's use of loaded terms like \"transparency\" and \"dark money\" notwithstanding, such a blatant attack on donor privacy will unquestionably be harder to justify than one for which a pretextual law enforcement justification can be maintained.\n\nThe judicial outcomes described in the preceding discussion certainly do not imply that donor privacy advocates should give up on litigation as a strategy for achieving their goals. As noted in Part 5, Judge Cote's decision in Citizens Union v. New York gives us some reason to hope that, just as in NAACP v. Alabama, federal courts will sometimes protect donor privacy from egregiously forthright attacks. What's more, it is certainly still possible the Supreme Court one day will hand down a decision that strengthens its NAACP v. Alabama holding.\n\nThe plaintiffs who are challenging the disclosure orders promulgated by the attorneys general of New York and California have all filed petitions asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the circuit court decisions that upheld those rules. The Supreme Court may grant one or more of those petitions, and, if it does, it may overrule the lower courts and hold that administratively imposed donor disclosure requirements violate the U.S. Constitution even when they are ostensibly imposed for law enforcement purposes. It is even possible the court will find that requiring nonprofits that are not directly involved in electioneering to disclose the names of their donors is unconstitutional on its face. If that were to happen, it would stop the current attack on donor privacy and prevent recurrences once and for all. It is therefore very much worthwhile for donor privacy advocates to do all they can to influence the outcome of these and all similar cases.\n\nHowever, there are other things privacy advocates should do as well. They should watch out for, and oppose, legislative proposals to require donor disclosure under state law. They should also advocate in favor of legislation that forbids administrative disclosure demands like the ones made by Eric Schneiderman in New York and by Kamala Harris in California. West Virginia and Mississippi have already enacted donor privacy protection laws that forbid state agencies from making such demands, and other states, including North Carolina, would do well to follow their example. (Copies of the laws are provided in Appendix A and Appendix B.)\n\nThe two laws have a lot in common. Both include provisions forbidding state officers from demanding information that could be used to identify donors to nonprofit organizations. Both forbid the release of any such information if it comes into the state's possession despite the law. Both specifically state that the law does not apply to court orders. Enforcement is the biggest difference between the two. The West Virginia law only provides civil remedies if the law is violated, including treble damages in cases of intentional disclosure. Mississippi's law, on the other hand, states, \"A person who knowingly violates this act is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of not more than ninety (90) days or a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or both.\" There are, no doubt, pros and cons to each approach to enforcement, and there are other more subtle differences between the two laws that will need to be analyzed and evaluated by legislators considering similar bills.\n\nFreedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances, are all fundamental human rights that deserve to be protected for their own sake. However, they also need to be protected because they are essential to the operation of our republican system of government and, ultimately, to the survival of our free society.\n\nLaws and administrative orders that impose donor disclosure requirements on nonprofit organizations make people afraid to exercise their expressive rights, which is why the fight for donor privacy is so important. To the extent that we can, we should support the nonprofit challenges to donor disclosure laws and administrative orders in court, but this is not something most North Carolinians are in a position to do.\n\nWhat we can do, however, is oppose any donor disclosure laws that may be introduced in the North Carolina General Assembly. We can also encourage the General Assembly to enact donor privacy protection laws like the ones enacted in West Virginia and Mississippi.\n\nAN ACT to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new article, designated \u00a71-7-1, \u00a71-7-2, \u00a71-7-3, and \u00a71-7-4, all relating generally to protecting an individual's constitutional right to privacy in association; creating the Protect Our Right to Unite Act; declaring legislative purpose; defining terms; providing that a public agency may not require a nonprofit entity to disclose the entity's donor or membership information, subject to certain exceptions; providing that donor or membership information obtained by a public agency may not be released, subject to certain exceptions; providing that membership and donor information is exempt from the disclosure requirements of the state's Freedom of Information Act; permitting disclosure of records when donor or membership information is redacted; permitting compliance with a lawful court order; providing that an individual has a private cause of action to enjoin unlawful disclosure of donor or membership information and to recover actual damages; providing for the payment of attorney's fees and costs in certain circumstances; and providing for treble damages in certain circumstances.\n\nBe it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:\n\nThe purpose of this article is to protect an individual's constitutional right to privately associate with advocacy groups that represent his or her beliefs. As the Supreme Court of the United States held in NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), compelled disclosure of an advocacy group's donor or membership lists, where such disclosure would discourage association, is a trespass upon the fundamental freedoms protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, this article should be liberally construed in favor of an individual's right to association, to ensure that private association is not discouraged or suppressed by any actions of the public agencies of this state.\n\nAN ACT TO PROVIDE THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY SHALL NOT REQUIRE ANY ENTITY ORGANIZED UNDER SECTION 501(C) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC AGENCY WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION; TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS PROHIBITION; TO PROVIDE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATIONS OF THIS ACT; TO AMEND SECTION 25-61-3, MISSISSIPPI CODE OF 1972, TO CONFORM TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT; AND FOR RELATED PURPOSES.\n\nBE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:\n\nSECTION 1.\n\nAs used in this act, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings as defined in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:\n\nA person who knowingly violates this act is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of not more than ninety (90) days or a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or both.\n\nSECTION 5.\n\nThe requirements of this act shall not affect any provisions of the Mississippi Campaign Finance statutes provided in Sections 23-15-801 et seq.\n\nSECTION 6.\n\nSection 25-61-3, Mississippi Code of 1972, is amended as follows:\n\n25-61-3.

Scholars have recognized that the modern-day control of social, economic, political and cultural aspects of former colonies by modern powers is still happening. They call it \"neocolonialism.\"\n\nAs public health experts who have worked extensively on global health issues, we've been struck by how this neocolonialist attitude has played out in this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization has sent a message to every country in the world during this pandemic: \"Test, test, test.\"\n\nBut not every country felt the message was meant for them. In mid-March the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. Yet at a press conference, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, stated that the WHO guidelines did not apply to the UK's \"extremely well-developed public health system.'\" She explained that WHO's recommended approach for all countries were actually meant more for lower income countries.\n\nNeedless to say, that philosophy did not stick.\n\nThe government now recommends widespread testing and in fact set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the U.K. by the end of April.\n\nThe U.K. and other onetime colonial powers did not turn to their former colonies or to the East for advice - although they should have.\n\nAfrican and Asian countries have had far more experience dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS than the United States and the countries of Europe. But neocolonialism relies on the continued belief that former colonial rulers are superior in terms of expertise and societal values. Not only are such attitudes racist and xenophobic, they're illogical.\n\nAnd it represents a kind of overconfidence that has literally been deadly. There was public knowledge of a viral respiratory epidemic threat from China in January, yet serious nationwide public health responses in the U.S. and U.K. did not start until March 2020.\n\nEven once it became clear that wealthy countries were at risk, there was a widespread reluctance to learn from China and from other Asian countries.\n\nThe American reaction focused instead on blaming China - consider President Trump's use of the term \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nChina was further criticized for using draconian measures when millions of people in Wuhan were put under lockdown - even though the countries of the West that denigrated such tactics might today be better off if they had acted similarly.\n\nIndeed, recent data suggests that the majority of cases in the United States came from New York City. Restricting travel out of the city, as was done in Wuhan, might have meant far fewer cases in the U.S.\n\nAnd while Trump put an early ban on much travel from China, effective Feb. 1, he delayed any travel bans from European countries even as the virus toll mounted until mid-March. Today, we know that most of the cases in the eastern U.S. were of European origin.\n\nThen there is the matter of face masks.\n\nAt first the U.S. made it seem as if wearing masks was based on superstition and had no benefit. So the message was that the mask-wearing citizens of China and other Asian countries were being foolish. As late as Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.\n\nBut the data is showing that universal masking could dramatically curb transmission. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did in fact change its earlier view and endorse the public use of cloth masks. To us, the hesitancy to adopt universal masking in public has been another example of Western arrogance.\n\nWhat's more, even former colonies are influenced by neocolonialism in the way they make decisions.\n\nSome of the solutions that work in the West are being imported by lower-income countries without consideration to whether they can work and what unforeseen consequences there might be.\n\nIt's one thing for a country like Italy, Spain or the U.K. to call for a full-country lockdown. Many workers can switch to at-home work and not lose income. But in countries with widespread poverty, a lockdown immediately means the end of income for street vendors, construction workers and many others who earn their living day-by-day - and the very real threat of hunger as their income evaporates.\n\nAnother argument for lockdowns is that if fewer people become ill, health-care systems will not be overwhelmed and will have time to acquire the equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nBut in low-income settings, that kind of gearing up is much harder to accomplish. They already have far fewer ventilators, ICU-level beds and critical-care trained doctors.\n\nAnd the government doesn't necessarily have the ability to finance that kind of scaling up. One reason, in our opinion, is the nature of so-called \"structural adjustment grants\" offered to low-income countries by the World Bank since the second half of the 20th century. The idea was that the money would be used to build up the private sector rather than to strengthen essential social systems like health care. And these grants have a legacy of ongoing debt that countries are still paying back to this day.\n\nYet in spite of it all, we see some signs of hope - ways that the world is rejecting neocolonialism.\n\nA new attitude is emerging: The idea that countries that have responded to outbreaks for so long have something to teach the West. These countries that battled Ebola already have systems in place to do a job that everyone says is critical for controlling the novel coronavirus: contact tracing. They know how to gather information about all the contacts of a newly diagnosed person and then set up systems to isolate those contacts until the risk of infection has passed. We can and must adopt their expertise here as well - and we are. The state of Massachusetts is collaborating with global health group Partners In Health to use the contact tracing and isolation strategies that were initially honed in the Ebola response in West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also new partnerships to train community health workers, learning from the work of Last Mile Health, which leads such programs in Liberia.\n\nThat's progress - but not enough progress.\n\nThe lessons and expertise of the East and of African countries, coupled with the resources and power of the West, could have allowed us all to fare better. And as COVID-19 spreads globally, we will be called upon to collaborate.\n\nWe need to make sure we answer that call.\n\nAbraar Karan is an internal medicine physician and clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Scholars have recognized that the modern-day control of social, economic, political and cultural aspects of former colonies by modern powers is still happening. They call it \"neocolonialism.\"\n\nAs public health experts who have worked extensively on global health issues, we've been struck by how this neocolonialist attitude has played out in this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization has sent a message to every country in the world during this pandemic: \"Test, test, test.\"\n\nBut not every country felt the message was meant for them. In mid-March the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. Yet at a press conference, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, stated that the WHO guidelines did not apply to the UK's \"extremely well-developed public health system.'\" She explained that WHO's recommended approach for all countries were actually meant more for lower income countries.\n\nNeedless to say, that philosophy did not stick.\n\nThe government now recommends widespread testing and in fact set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the U.K. by the end of April.\n\nThe U.K. and other onetime colonial powers did not turn to their former colonies or to the East for advice - although they should have.\n\nAfrican and Asian countries have had far more experience dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS than the United States and the countries of Europe. But neocolonialism relies on the continued belief that former colonial rulers are superior in terms of expertise and societal values. Not only are such attitudes racist and xenophobic, they're illogical.\n\nAnd it represents a kind of overconfidence that has literally been deadly. There was public knowledge of a viral respiratory epidemic threat from China in January, yet serious nationwide public health responses in the U.S. and U.K. did not start until March 2020.\n\nEven once it became clear that wealthy countries were at risk, there was a widespread reluctance to learn from China and from other Asian countries.\n\nThe American reaction focused instead on blaming China - consider President Trump's use of the term \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nChina was further criticized for using draconian measures when millions of people in Wuhan were put under lockdown - even though the countries of the West that denigrated such tactics might today be better off if they had acted similarly.\n\nIndeed, recent data suggests that the majority of cases in the United States came from New York City. Restricting travel out of the city, as was done in Wuhan, might have meant far fewer cases in the U.S.\n\nAnd while Trump put an early ban on much travel from China, effective Feb. 1, he delayed any travel bans from European countries even as the virus toll mounted until mid-March. Today, we know that most of the cases in the eastern U.S. were of European origin.\n\nThen there is the matter of face masks.\n\nAt first the U.S. made it seem as if wearing masks was based on superstition and had no benefit. So the message was that the mask-wearing citizens of China and other Asian countries were being foolish. As late as Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.\n\nBut the data is showing that universal masking could dramatically curb transmission. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did in fact change its earlier view and endorse the public use of cloth masks. To us, the hesitancy to adopt universal masking in public has been another example of Western arrogance.\n\nWhat's more, even former colonies are influenced by neocolonialism in the way they make decisions.\n\nSome of the solutions that work in the West are being imported by lower-income countries without consideration to whether they can work and what unforeseen consequences there might be.\n\nIt's one thing for a country like Italy, Spain or the U.K. to call for a full-country lockdown. Many workers can switch to at-home work and not lose income. But in countries with widespread poverty, a lockdown immediately means the end of income for street vendors, construction workers and many others who earn their living day-by-day - and the very real threat of hunger as their income evaporates.\n\nAnother argument for lockdowns is that if fewer people become ill, health-care systems will not be overwhelmed and will have time to acquire the equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nBut in low-income settings, that kind of gearing up is much harder to accomplish. They already have far fewer ventilators, ICU-level beds and critical-care trained doctors.\n\nAnd the government doesn't necessarily have the ability to finance that kind of scaling up. One reason, in our opinion, is the nature of so-called \"structural adjustment grants\" offered to low-income countries by the World Bank since the second half of the 20th century. The idea was that the money would be used to build up the private sector rather than to strengthen essential social systems like health care. And these grants have a legacy of ongoing debt that countries are still paying back to this day.\n\nYet in spite of it all, we see some signs of hope - ways that the world is rejecting neocolonialism.\n\nA new attitude is emerging: The idea that countries that have responded to outbreaks for so long have something to teach the West. These countries that battled Ebola already have systems in place to do a job that everyone says is critical for controlling the novel coronavirus: contact tracing. They know how to gather information about all the contacts of a newly diagnosed person and then set up systems to isolate those contacts until the risk of infection has passed. We can and must adopt their expertise here as well - and we are. The state of Massachusetts is collaborating with global health group Partners In Health to use the contact tracing and isolation strategies that were initially honed in the Ebola response in West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also new partnerships to train community health workers, learning from the work of Last Mile Health, which leads such programs in Liberia.\n\nThat's progress - but not enough progress.\n\nThe lessons and expertise of the East and of African countries, coupled with the resources and power of the West, could have allowed us all to fare better. And as COVID-19 spreads globally, we will be called upon to collaborate.\n\nWe need to make sure we answer that call.\n\nAbraar Karan is an internal medicine physician and clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

A well-studied consequence of excessive insolvency proceedings is premature liquidations, more retrenchment and fewer investments- which is borne out by India's experience and these effects may be further amplified on account of the endemic stress.\n\nThe World Bank, in a recent blog has recommended policy measures to strengthen the insolvency framework of countries to save firms and boost economic recovery- these included extraordinary measures to suspend fillings. The Finance Minister announced a suspension of fresh fillings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (\"IBC\") on May 24 and the Ordinance in this regard is awaited- India joins jurisdictions such as Spain, Turkey and Latvia to introduce suspension of fillings. Although the details are awaited, the contours indicated in the Finance Minister's press conference indicate that it will defer fresh fillings for a period of one year- indicating that existing proceedings may continue. Additionally, default on \"COVID related\" debt is likely to be excluded from the definition of debt under the IBC.\n\nThe suspension of IBC will necessitate a creative evolution of the resolution landscape- deploying existing legal tools as well as fashioning new ones to resolve and restructure intractable debt. This crisis provides an opportunity to bolster other mechanisms and institutions to help preserve value in businesses and mitigate the build up of stress for the financial system.\n\nAmong the existing tools available for is a scheme of creditors arrangement under Section 230 of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"Companies Act\"). Although not utilised in breach so far, in the absence of the IBC, creditors schemes under the Companies Act could provide a feasible alternative to resolution under the IBC. Among the advantages it presents are that it is binding on all stakeholders and the grounds for judicial review are limited. However, a creditors scheme does not provide for an automatic moratorium, unlike the IBC, potentially leaving open the possibility that creditors could initiate precipitative action to enforce security or seek injunctions which could imperil a collective action through a creditors scheme. The NCLT may have appropriate inherent powers to provide for a moratorium, however, this is untested. Another challenge is the requirement for approval of 75% of each class of creditors, as well as shareholder approval which will be difficult to achieve in a timely manner with minimal erosion of value. The requirement for shareholder approval is particularly testing when there may be limited equity value in a stressed company. Creditors schemes may, however, be a useful device when promoters, management and shareholders are seeking to consensually restructure or resolve debt with their creditors- a debtor in possession model.\n\nThe World Bank as well as thought leaders in the insolvency space such as the International Insolvency Institute have underscored the need for buttressing out-of-court workout mechanisms. In India, the Stressed Asset Directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India provide such a framework for banks and financial institutions to consensually arrive at a resolution plan for a borrower facing stress and has been a qualified success. However, following regulatory mandates, companies increasingly meet their funding requirement through the corporate bond route and therefore have diverse and disaggregated creditors. For a resolution to be collective and yield higher value, all creditors must come to the table and participate. This may require SEBI and other regulators to encourage their regulated entities to also participate in the resolution process. A structured process to incentivise promoter cooperation as well as for the resolution to finally bind all creditors as well as the company limits the efficacy of this route.\n\nGreater regulatory cohesion and cooperation is indispensable to achieve effective resolution and to this end, SEBI's recent proposal to amend regulations to ease funding in stressed companies; balancing funding imperatives with governance concerns is opportune. An entire ecosystem of regulatory amendments similar to the alignments made for IBC may be useful to alleviate COVID - induced stress.\n\nOne effective way to deal with this may be to frame a mechanism for \"prepacked resolution\" as has been considered by certain other jurisdictions. By way of example, the UK introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill, 2020 on May 20, 2020 which proposed a \"restructuring vehicle\" which corporates the many benefits of the scheme with considerable additional flexibility, such as crucially a cross class cramdown. India similarly must seize the opportunity to create a nimble yet legally binding pre-packaged insolvency framework. Such a framework should provide for collective resolution between creditors, yet permit cramdown where appropriate safeguards are provided; balance transparency and maximisation of value with expediency and bind all stakeholders. To this end, it may be evaluated by the Tribunal a) will it yield more value than individual enforcement/liquidation, (b) does it address the interests of all stakeholders (c) does the process meet the norms of transparency and maximizing value. Such a plan must be made binding on all parties. Safeguards in the prepackaged scheme should prevents creditors from writing down other categories of creditors, when they may have relinquished.\n\nThe magnitude of stress that is likely to follow compels a more systemic response. For this, a \"Bad Bank\" may be good idea whose time has come. This tool has been considered in policy circles since 2016 there is not time like the present to effect a well-designed, well governed bad bank - which is being considered globally, for instance in the EU, and was a response following the 2008 crisis as well. For the bad bank to have the requisite agility, the ownership must be a combination of government and private sources - Bank for International Settlements Research demonstrates that a mix of private and public sector ownership combine the relative strengths of the two sectors. Additionally, governance structures of the entity should encourage quick solutions.\n\nThe bad bank may help sweep out (and then resolve) NPAs from bank balance sheets, freeing up precious capital for fresh lending. However, a framework for financial sector resolution to deal with potential stress should also be available in the quiver of policy makers.\n\nThe landscape for resolution following the COVID crisis will be significantly different, and this is be the time to shape its contours.", "uri": "6085320854", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/evolving-resolution-landscape-ibc-and-outside-11590772760385.html"}], "6085320453": [463022841, {"sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:39:00Z", "name": "CHEd bats vouchers for kids of OFWs to ensure they continue schooling | Inquirer News", "dtype": "news", "pk": 463022841, "text": "MANILA, Philippines -- The Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) on Friday proposed a voucher system for children of displaced overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), that would ensure that they continue with their studies amid the economic challenges posed by the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nIn the joint virtual hearing of the Senate committees on finance and public affairs, CHEd chairman Prospero de Vera said that the voucher system would be a \"laudible initiative.\"\n\n\"We can target for example, the first batch, yung mga anak ng OFWs na umuwi na hindi made-deploy.

Scholars have recognized that the modern-day control of social, economic, political and cultural aspects of former colonies by modern powers is still happening. They call it \"neocolonialism.\"\n\nAs public health experts who have worked extensively on global health issues, we've been struck by how this neocolonialist attitude has played out in this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization has sent a message to every country in the world during this pandemic: \"Test, test, test.\"\n\nBut not every country felt the message was meant for them. In mid-March the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. Yet at a press conference, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, stated that the WHO guidelines did not apply to the UK's \"extremely well-developed public health system.'\" She explained that WHO's recommended approach for all countries were actually meant more for lower income countries.\n\nNeedless to say, that philosophy did not stick.\n\nThe government now recommends widespread testing and in fact set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the U.K. by the end of April.\n\nThe U.K. and other onetime colonial powers did not turn to their former colonies or to the East for advice - although they should have.\n\nAfrican and Asian countries have had far more experience dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS than the United States and the countries of Europe. But neocolonialism relies on the continued belief that former colonial rulers are superior in terms of expertise and societal values. Not only are such attitudes racist and xenophobic, they're illogical.\n\nAnd it represents a kind of overconfidence that has literally been deadly. There was public knowledge of a viral respiratory epidemic threat from China in January, yet serious nationwide public health responses in the U.S. and U.K. did not start until March 2020.\n\nEven once it became clear that wealthy countries were at risk, there was a widespread reluctance to learn from China and from other Asian countries.\n\nThe American reaction focused instead on blaming China - consider President Trump's use of the term \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nChina was further criticized for using draconian measures when millions of people in Wuhan were put under lockdown - even though the countries of the West that denigrated such tactics might today be better off if they had acted similarly.\n\nIndeed, recent data suggests that the majority of cases in the United States came from New York City. Restricting travel out of the city, as was done in Wuhan, might have meant far fewer cases in the U.S.\n\nAnd while Trump put an early ban on much travel from China, effective Feb. 1, he delayed any travel bans from European countries even as the virus toll mounted until mid-March. Today, we know that most of the cases in the eastern U.S. were of European origin.\n\nThen there is the matter of face masks.\n\nAt first the U.S. made it seem as if wearing masks was based on superstition and had no benefit. So the message was that the mask-wearing citizens of China and other Asian countries were being foolish. As late as Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.\n\nBut the data is showing that universal masking could dramatically curb transmission. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did in fact change its earlier view and endorse the public use of cloth masks. To us, the hesitancy to adopt universal masking in public has been another example of Western arrogance.\n\nWhat's more, even former colonies are influenced by neocolonialism in the way they make decisions.\n\nSome of the solutions that work in the West are being imported by lower-income countries without consideration to whether they can work and what unforeseen consequences there might be.\n\nIt's one thing for a country like Italy, Spain or the U.K. to call for a full-country lockdown. Many workers can switch to at-home work and not lose income. But in countries with widespread poverty, a lockdown immediately means the end of income for street vendors, construction workers and many others who earn their living day-by-day - and the very real threat of hunger as their income evaporates.\n\nAnother argument for lockdowns is that if fewer people become ill, health-care systems will not be overwhelmed and will have time to acquire the equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nBut in low-income settings, that kind of gearing up is much harder to accomplish. They already have far fewer ventilators, ICU-level beds and critical-care trained doctors.\n\nAnd the government doesn't necessarily have the ability to finance that kind of scaling up. One reason, in our opinion, is the nature of so-called \"structural adjustment grants\" offered to low-income countries by the World Bank since the second half of the 20th century. The idea was that the money would be used to build up the private sector rather than to strengthen essential social systems like health care. And these grants have a legacy of ongoing debt that countries are still paying back to this day.\n\nYet in spite of it all, we see some signs of hope - ways that the world is rejecting neocolonialism.\n\nA new attitude is emerging: The idea that countries that have responded to outbreaks for so long have something to teach the West. These countries that battled Ebola already have systems in place to do a job that everyone says is critical for controlling the novel coronavirus: contact tracing. They know how to gather information about all the contacts of a newly diagnosed person and then set up systems to isolate those contacts until the risk of infection has passed. We can and must adopt their expertise here as well - and we are. The state of Massachusetts is collaborating with global health group Partners In Health to use the contact tracing and isolation strategies that were initially honed in the Ebola response in West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also new partnerships to train community health workers, learning from the work of Last Mile Health, which leads such programs in Liberia.\n\nThat's progress - but not enough progress.\n\nThe lessons and expertise of the East and of African countries, coupled with the resources and power of the West, could have allowed us all to fare better. And as COVID-19 spreads globally, we will be called upon to collaborate.\n\nWe need to make sure we answer that call.\n\nAbraar Karan is an internal medicine physician and clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

In 1963, he had the opportunity to attend Atlanta's Morehouse College, an HBCU that imparted not only an education but a religious and cultural foundation that would later lead to a Master's degree and a successful business career serving as the CEO of both a major restaurant chain and the National Restaurant Association.\n\nMr. Blackwell has seen the importance of HBCUs from a slightly different perspective. After serving as mayor of Cincinnati and Ohio's treasurer of state, he had the opportunity to join the board of trustees of Ohio's Wilberforce University, which in the 1860s became America's very first black-owned institution of higher learning. That role gave him firsthand insights into the impact that HBCUs such as Wilberforce continue to make in the lives of young black Americans.\n\nWe can both further state that there has never been a president in the White House who has been more supportive of HBCUs and their mission than President Trump. Through both legislation he has championed and executive action he has taken independently, the president has shown time and again that his administration is committed to promoting the survival and relevance of distinctively African American institutions of higher education in this country.\n\nJust after taking office, one of Donald Trump's very first executive orders established both a White House initiative and a board of advisors on HBCUs, placing them at the very center of this administration's education policy. He subsequently relaunched the HBCU Capital Finance Board, which has distributed over $500 million in student loans.\n\nCabinet-level federal agencies have also gotten in the game. Attorney General Bill Barr's Justice Department, for example, issued an opinion that will allow faith-based HBCUs, such as Morehouse and Wilberforce, to enjoy the same access to federal support for capital improvement projects as secular institutions.\n\nPresident Trump is also providing more funding for HBCUs than any other president in history. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) that he signed into law last year included $255 million in permanent, mandatory funding for HBCUs, and the 2019 Farm Bill included an additional $100 million for HBCU scholarships, research, and centers of excellence.\n\nThe scale and duration of President Trump's commitment to HBCUs is a story often ignored in the popular press, but it fits neatly within the framework of his governing philosophy. This administration has the interests of all citizens at heart and is always trying to fund and support solutions that truly empower black Americans. It is no coincidence that African American unemployment and poverty rates both reached all-time lows under President Trump before the coronavirus pandemic struck.\n\nAs the country prepares to restart and rebuild from the pandemic, the Trump administration's commitment to HBCUs takes on added importance. President Trump knows that HBCUs will have a role to play in the coming challenge, which is why he included $1 billion in relief to HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions as part of federal pandemic relief efforts.\n\nAs the entire country strives to return to a new normal over the coming months, HBCUs and the wider African American community can take comfort in the knowledge that they have an unwavering ally in the White House.", "uri": "6085249589", "url": "https://patriotpost.us/opinion/71014-trump-hbcus-and-progress-2020-05-29"}], "6085318097": [456272818, {"sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:20:00Z", "name": "LandBank may offer parents loans for tuition | Nation | Daily Tribune", "dtype": "news", "pk": 456272818, "text": "President Duterte said that he will order Land Bank branches to extend loans to parents needing money to finance the education of their children under pandemic conditions.\n\nIn addressing the nation from the Malaca\u00f1ang Golf Clubhouse, Duterte assured parents needing money for tuition the government is ready to assist them in ways it can.\n\n\"And for those who have nothing when it comes to obligations, we have the Land Bank where you can borrow money to finance the education of your children,\" Duterte said.\n\n\"I want the development of this endeavor for Land Bank to help.

J.B. Pritzker said he would extend the statewide moratorium on evictions as mounting unemployment puts thousands of residents in danger of missing more payments next week. Legislators also increased funding for a tenant and landlord relief fund and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is proposing extending protections for tenants facing no-fault evictions. Chicago has also made some financial moves to preserve and acquire subsidized housing units.\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago Tribune reports that although 89 people in Chicaog's low-income housing have died due to COVID-19, subsidized housing residents have been told little, if anything, about cases where they live, even though they are generally older and in poorer health.\n\nRELATED:\n\nSome Chicagoans may be facing coronavirus threat without water at home\n\nRemote learning: Newly unveiled data shows that fewer than 60% of Chicago Public Schools students are engaging with online remote learning three or more days per week even though more than 90% of students have digital access.

Last week, city officials acknowledged that they don't have a plan to restore services to residents who had their water disconnected but that affected individuals should contact the city's finance department to enroll in a payment plan to get their water restored, offering little recourse for renters who rely on their landlords to pay the city for water services.

Scholars have recognized that the modern-day control of social, economic, political and cultural aspects of former colonies by modern powers is still happening. They call it \"neocolonialism.\"\n\nAs public health experts who have worked extensively on global health issues, we've been struck by how this neocolonialist attitude has played out in this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization has sent a message to every country in the world during this pandemic: \"Test, test, test.\"\n\nBut not every country felt the message was meant for them. In mid-March the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. Yet at a press conference, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, stated that the WHO guidelines did not apply to the UK's \"extremely well-developed public health system.'\" She explained that WHO's recommended approach for all countries were actually meant more for lower income countries.\n\nNeedless to say, that philosophy did not stick.\n\nThe government now recommends widespread testing and in fact set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the U.K. by the end of April.\n\nThe U.K. and other onetime colonial powers did not turn to their former colonies or to the East for advice - although they should have.\n\nAfrican and Asian countries have had far more experience dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS than the United States and the countries of Europe. But neocolonialism relies on the continued belief that former colonial rulers are superior in terms of expertise and societal values. Not only are such attitudes racist and xenophobic, they're illogical.\n\nAnd it represents a kind of overconfidence that has literally been deadly. There was public knowledge of a viral respiratory epidemic threat from China in January, yet serious nationwide public health responses in the U.S. and U.K. did not start until March 2020.\n\nEven once it became clear that wealthy countries were at risk, there was a widespread reluctance to learn from China and from other Asian countries.\n\nThe American reaction focused instead on blaming China - consider President Trump's use of the term \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nChina was further criticized for using draconian measures when millions of people in Wuhan were put under lockdown - even though the countries of the West that denigrated such tactics might today be better off if they had acted similarly.\n\nIndeed, recent data suggests that the majority of cases in the United States came from New York City. Restricting travel out of the city, as was done in Wuhan, might have meant far fewer cases in the U.S.\n\nAnd while Trump put an early ban on much travel from China, effective Feb. 1, he delayed any travel bans from European countries even as the virus toll mounted until mid-March. Today, we know that most of the cases in the eastern U.S. were of European origin.\n\nThen there is the matter of face masks.\n\nAt first the U.S. made it seem as if wearing masks was based on superstition and had no benefit. So the message was that the mask-wearing citizens of China and other Asian countries were being foolish. As late as Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.\n\nBut the data is showing that universal masking could dramatically curb transmission. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did in fact change its earlier view and endorse the public use of cloth masks. To us, the hesitancy to adopt universal masking in public has been another example of Western arrogance.\n\nWhat's more, even former colonies are influenced by neocolonialism in the way they make decisions.\n\nSome of the solutions that work in the West are being imported by lower-income countries without consideration to whether they can work and what unforeseen consequences there might be.\n\nIt's one thing for a country like Italy, Spain or the U.K. to call for a full-country lockdown. Many workers can switch to at-home work and not lose income. But in countries with widespread poverty, a lockdown immediately means the end of income for street vendors, construction workers and many others who earn their living day-by-day - and the very real threat of hunger as their income evaporates.\n\nAnother argument for lockdowns is that if fewer people become ill, health-care systems will not be overwhelmed and will have time to acquire the equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nBut in low-income settings, that kind of gearing up is much harder to accomplish. They already have far fewer ventilators, ICU-level beds and critical-care trained doctors.\n\nAnd the government doesn't necessarily have the ability to finance that kind of scaling up. One reason, in our opinion, is the nature of so-called \"structural adjustment grants\" offered to low-income countries by the World Bank since the second half of the 20th century. The idea was that the money would be used to build up the private sector rather than to strengthen essential social systems like health care. And these grants have a legacy of ongoing debt that countries are still paying back to this day.\n\nYet in spite of it all, we see some signs of hope - ways that the world is rejecting neocolonialism.\n\nA new attitude is emerging: The idea that countries that have responded to outbreaks for so long have something to teach the West. These countries that battled Ebola already have systems in place to do a job that everyone says is critical for controlling the novel coronavirus: contact tracing. They know how to gather information about all the contacts of a newly diagnosed person and then set up systems to isolate those contacts until the risk of infection has passed. We can and must adopt their expertise here as well - and we are. The state of Massachusetts is collaborating with global health group Partners In Health to use the contact tracing and isolation strategies that were initially honed in the Ebola response in West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also new partnerships to train community health workers, learning from the work of Last Mile Health, which leads such programs in Liberia.\n\nThat's progress - but not enough progress.\n\nThe lessons and expertise of the East and of African countries, coupled with the resources and power of the West, could have allowed us all to fare better. And as COVID-19 spreads globally, we will be called upon to collaborate.\n\nWe need to make sure we answer that call.\n\nAbraar Karan is an internal medicine physician and clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

The draw for the final runners took place this Friday. Find out the latest news on these two Group 1 Classic races, defining events for the 3-year-old generation, below.\n\nThe \"Poules d'Essai\", or French Guineas, are Classic races, reserved for 3-year-old colts and fillies with the aim of selecting the best Thoroughbred breeding prospects. The race takes place over a distance of a mile, or 1,600 meters. To race over this distance requires both speed and stamina.\n\nWhilst an objective in itself, the Poules d'Essai is also a springboard into the other Classic races of the first half of the flat racing season, the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prix de Diane Longines. Both of these races take place over 2,100 meters at Chantilly racecourse. Some horses, who are specialists over the distance of a mile, do not run to the same level when the distance is increased by 500 meters, and so remain in the 'miler' category. They will take on the older horses later in the year.\n\nOthers, however, have enough stamina to run over 2,000 meters or more. These horses will attempt the prestigious double of the \" Poule d'Essai - Jockey Club / Diane \". A select number of dual Classic winners have been seen in recent years: Shamardal (2005), Lope de Vega (2010) and Brametot (2017) for the colts; Divine Proportions (2005), Zarkava (2008), Golden Lilac (2011), Avenir Certain (2014) and La Cressonni\u00e8re (2016) for the fillies.\n\nAmongst these champions, only one has gone on to then win the Qatar Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the nominal world championship for Thoroughbred racehorses: this was the great Zarkava, who retired to stud unbeaten in October 2008.\n\nThe worldwide epidemic crisis has not been without consequences for horse racing. After a two-month period when racing was stopped entirely, competition restarted on the 11 May, but behind locked doors and only on racecourses in designated green zones. The Poules d'Essai, which traditionally takes place in early May at the racecourse of ParisLongchamp, was pushed back to the 1 June and has found refuge at Deauville-La Touques racecourse. However, this is not the first time that the Normandy track has hosted this prestigious event. It was also held here in 2016 and 2017 when renovation works were taking place at ParisLongchamp. One of the main differences is that Deauville boasts a long home straight, allowing the race to be run in on a straight course, as is the case for the British equivalent (the Newmarket Guineas). The draw is of primordial importance on the turning track at ParisLongchamp, as the first turn comes up quickly so a good position can make all the difference in the finish. On the straight track, the draw is far less influential. Winners can come from a low draw, such as Brametot and Pr\u00e9cieuse in 2017 (stall 3), and also from an outside draw, as did The Gurkha in 2016 (stall 11).\n\nDeauville's annual highlight is traditionally the August meeting. The track is maintained to the highest standards throughout the year however, due to the 800 horses that are trained on the site. The trainers are allowed to use the racetrack for important gallops in the mornings prior to big engagements. Franck Le Mestre, who manages both the racecourse and the training centre, has been working continuously to ensure a perfect grass surface for this weekend. \"We have been watering the track since Sunday evening, after the last race meeting. The grass was levelled to 13cm. The aim is to have a ground-stick reading of 3.3 or 3.4 on Sunday and Monday morning, to have a good ground in the afternoon. I have to mention the fantastic work of the team here during the lockdown period. The track has been maintained daily despite the reduced number of personnel. We have had very little rain over the last two months, and it is forecast to be dry and sunny between now and Monday. So the program for us is quite simple: water, mow, and we're ready to go!\"\n\nThere is no rain expected between now and Monday. The forecast for Monday is sunny with temperatures reaching a maximum of 23\u00b0C.\n\nChantilly based Andr\u00e9 Fabre is the winning-most trainer taking part in Monday's Poule d'Essai des Poulains. He has won this race on seven occasions and saddles one of this year's favourites, Victor Ludorum, as well as Arapaho and Alson, both of whom line up with good chances. He has won the fillies' equivalent 'only' three times, but again is well represented this year with Tropbeau and Tickle me Green.\n\nJean-Claude Rouget, whose training string is split between Pau and Deauville, counts four wins in the\n\nPoule d'Essai des Pouliches. He is represented this year by the unbeaten Simeen and could well be on his way to equal the record of legendary trainers Fran\u00e7ois Mathet and Alec Head (both of whom won this race on five occasions).\n\nSimeen runs in the colours of His Highness the Aga Khan, who has also won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches on four occasions, making him the winning-most owner in this year's race. These colours have been carried to glory in the colt's race on no less than eight separate occasions, however, there will be no representative for the famous green and red silks this year.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Jean-Claude Rouget won this race on two of the occasions when it was held previously at Deauville (Brametot for the colts in 2017, and La Cressonni\u00e8re in 2016, for the fillies), while Fabrice Chappet won his first Classic on this rack and in this race in 2017 thanks to Pr\u00e9cieuse.\n\nGroup 1 - 1,600m / 1 mile - 3-year-old colts - \u20ac360,000\n\nHe was the main attraction on the 11th May, the date which marked the return of racing to France. However, he ran too fresh and the Godolphin owned colt could only finish third in the Prix de Fontainebleau (Group 3), the main prep race for the Poule d'Essai. He is a son of the late, great Shamardal, who himself won this race in 2005 and who sadly died last April. He out-classed his opponents last October in the Qatar Prix Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re (Group 1), on the day of the Arc de Triomphe. He has incredible talent, but sometimes has trouble keeping his explosive energy under control. From this perspective, a straight track could prove difficult, but he undoubtedly has the required quality to win.\n\nThe Summit was the winner of the Prix de Fontainebleau (the main prep race for the Poule d'Essai), going from pillar to post, after having been beating on his return to the track as a 3-year-old Prix Omnium II (L) by the smallest of margins. He is trained at Beaupreau by Henri-Alex Pantall, who won the Poule des Pouliches last year with Castle Lady. The Summit showed his ability at the age of 2, finishing third in the Prix de Cond\u00e9 (Group 3) followed by an honourable fifth in the Crit\u00e9rium de Saint-Cloud (Group 1), in heavy ground. He has indubitably turned a cornerstone this year. He carries the colours of Mrs Jacques Cygler. These colours were carried by the Champion race mare Sistercharlie in her early career before she was bought by American owner Peter Brant. Second in the Prix de Diane 2017, in the U.S.A Sistercharlie has lined up success after success. She was named Champion Turf Filly in 2018 and has won no less than seven Group 1 races.\n\nThe Summit was bought as a yearling for just \u20ac16,000 at the Arqana Sales by bloodstock agent Paul Nataf who has worked with the Cyglers for many years. He was bred by Alec Waugh (Jedburgh Stud) in Normandy and is a son of leading French sire Wootton Bassett, who stands at Haras d'Etreham in Normandy. Wootton Bassett has previously produced a champion, Almanzor, who is also now at stud alongside his sire.\n\nKenway will be supported by the entire South-East region. He is trained by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rossi, who is based at the Calas-Cabri\u00e8s training centre, near Aix-en-Provence. Kenway carries the colours of Haras de la Gousserie, owned by Kamel Chehboub, an emblematic figure of racing in the South-East of France. Kenway is the most experienced of all the runners lining up in the race, having already taken part in nine races. He gave an exciting performance when winning the Prix La Rochette last year, a Group 3 prep race for the Qatar Prix Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re. He was unable to make an impression in the Group 1 however, on soft ground that he did not like. He comes to this race off a fourth place in the Prix de Fontainebleau, just a short head from Victor Ludorum.\n\nKenway was bred by Guy Pariente. This businessman built his breeding operation around his favourite stallion, Kendargent, the damsire of Kenway. Galiway, his sire, stands at the Haras de Colleville alongside Kendargent. Kenway is from his first crop and has been a significant contributor to his success as a stallion.\n\nKenway was bought for \u20ac56,000 at the Arqana Yearling Sales. It should be noted that his dam Kendam was an excellent racemare, winning the Prix Eclipse (Group 3). As for Galiway, he began his stud career at a fee of only \u20ac3,000 and now stands for \u20ac10,000, thanks to the results on the track from his first generations of offspring.\n\nGroup 1 - 1,600m / 1 mile - 3-year-old fillies - \u20ac300,000\n\nTropbeau is the obvious favourite of the race. Her performances leading into the race have been irreproachable. This filly is owned by Lady Bamford (whose colours were victorious in the 2015 Prix de Diane with Star of Seville) and is trained in Chantilly by Andr\u00e9 Fabre. She won on her return to the track this year in the Prix de la Grotte (Group 3), the main prep race for this event, proving that she is capable of 'staying' a mile. She showed a lot of speed as a 2-year-old, winning the Prix Six Perfections and the Calvados (both of which are run on the straight at Deauville!). Her connections then chose to go and take on the British in their back garden, running in the Cheveley Park Stakes (Group 1), where she finished with a commendable third place.\n\nSimeen will be Tropbeau's main competition. The filly, owned by His Highness the Aga Khan, has been prepared for the race at Deauville by Jean-Claude Rouget. She comes here unbeaten in three starts. As is his preference, Jean-Claude concocted a perfect 'prot\u00e9g\u00e9' program for her, making sure she has not had any hard races leading into the main event. Her career thus far has consisted of two wins from two runs at the age of 2, and another victory for her first run as a 3-year-old on her return to the track on the 13 May in a Class 1 race at Chantilly. Don't take the official finishing distance into account (short head). Christophe Soumillon had dropped his hands to ease her in the finish, certain of the victory. This Monday the duo will be giving it their all!\n\nLike Simeen, My Love's Passion knows Deauville racecourse like the back of her hand, as she trains there every day under the watchful eye of Yann Barberot, the former jockey who turned trainer a dozen years previously. There will be a crown of supporters (in front of French racing channel Equidia!) cheering on My Love's Passion, as she belongs to a syndicate, Passion Racing Club, which is run by Marcel Chaouat, the former managing director of Deauville racecourse. This club is made up of around a hundred racing fans finance the racing stable through private means, around 20 horses in training in all. My Love's Passion was bought for just \u20ac10,000 as a yearling, and she has already won more than ten times that amount for her owners! Her career-best performance came at Deauville when finishing second in the Darley Prix Robert Papin (Group 2), over 1,200 metres. She has never run over further than this distance of 1,200 metres, but her connections wanted to her to take her chance in this Classic event. My Love's Passion undoubtedly deserves her place in the line-up!\n\n- Carlos Laffon-Parias, trainer of \u00c9crivain\n\n\"\u00c9crivain ran very well in the Prix de Fontainebleau. That was simply a prep race, and the objective has always been the Poule d'Essai. It was an ideal comeback race. The straight track doesn't worry me, although I hope that we will have good ground that isn't too quick, as that could damage the horses.\"\n\n- Lisa-Jane Graffard, the French representative for Godolphin, owner of Victor Ludorum\n\n\"Andr\u00e9 Fabre is very happy with the colt as he is in top form. Having a runner in one of the Classics is always a huge moment. He was too fresh in the Prix de Fontainebleau and needed the race. It has done him good. We are in a year with exceptional circumstances, and everyone must adapt, people and horses. The only question mark we have is over the straight track, as he has never run on a straight before.\"\n\n- Mauricio Delcher Sanchez, trainer of Marieta\n\n\"Unfortunately for us, running on a straight track does not play in our favour. It's not ideal for those horses who have limited stamina, unlike a turning track where they have a chance to take a breath. Marieta in good form. We have had plenty of time to prepare her for this race. It will be her first race of the season. The decision not to run in a prep race was mine, and I assume the responsibility of it. She should have run in the Prix Imprudence (Group 3), but the race was removed from the program. The other option was the Prix de la Grotte (Group 3, 1.600m), but I felt running her over this distance just before the Poule would not suit her. I am even more happy that we didn't run her there as now the Poule will not be at ParisLongchamp, with the turn, but at Deauville. Tropbeau really impressed me when winning her prep, but overall these are all top-class fillies who deserve to take part in the race. I respect each and every one of the other runners, but none of them has so far looked invincible, unless with the exception of Tropbeau.\"\n\n- Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rossi, trainer of Dream and Do and Kenway\n\n\"Both my runners worked well on Tuesday. It was just a gallop to keep them ticking over: they both had a race three weeks prior to the Poule, when they made the long trip from Marseille to Paris. All the lights are on green. Kenway gave me confidence in the Prix de Fontainebleau. A lot of things did not go his way in the race, and he ran very well. He comes into the Poule d'Essai as an outsider, but he is capable of running well. Personally, the announcement that the race was switching to Deauville was good news, he is better on a straight track and the increased pace will help him. Dream and Do ran well for the seasonal reappearance in the Prix de la Grotte. She was a little fresh and not quite at 100 % for the race. Before then, the Fabre fillies were the ones to beat, but I think that this Poule d'Essai des Pouliches is quite open. Dream and Do worked well, has strengthened up, and I think she can run a big race.\"\n\n- Fabrice Chappet, trainer of C\u00e9lestin, Speak of the Devil and Mageva\n\n\"Speak of the Devil won her maiden brilliantly at Deauville last October. She then had an excellent lesson on her seasonal reappearance this year against the colts. She has a bad draw, and we wanted the race to be a learning experience. She finished remarkably well, only beaten by Shinning Ocean, who has been supplemented into the Poule d'Essai des Poulains. Since then she has been working very well. It remains to be seen whether she will be as effective against the top-class fillies of her generation, and on firm ground. I would have liked to bring her to this race with another run under her belt, but with the circumstances being what they are, she won't be the only one lining up with just two starts.\n\nLike Speak of the Devil, Mageva was brilliant when winning her first start, and again like the former, is a daughter of the remarkable sire Wootton Bassett who has already proved his ability to produce Classic horses. The Prix Imprudence was taken off the program this year, so we chose to run her in the Prix du Pont-Neuf (Listed, the race category just below Group), over 1,400 meters for her seasonal bow, as she has a lot of speed and can be a little keen. She also had a good learning experience, finishing very well behind Arapaho, who will be running in the colt's Classic. She is a really good ground filly, so she will have her preferred conditions this Monday.\n\nC\u00e9lestin ran a perfectly correct race on his return to competition. He is, without doubt, better on softer ground but he deserves to line up in the race. He is in great form.\"\n\n- Yann Barberot, trainer of My Love's Passion\n\n\"The filly has been working well, and the Poule d'Essai is run at home. The fact that the Poule is now on a straight track is good news for us! On a straight, My Love's Passion breathes well, something that not all horses are able to do. She worked on Tuesday over Monday's course and distance. If she runs as well as she worked... It's a challenge but I love it. She will be an outsider, but she is still a classy filly. It just remains to be seen whether she will stay the mile. If we are placed, we will be very happy! Gr\u00e9gory Benoist is injured, so Th\u00e9o Bachelot will ride. He rode her in the Prix Robert Papin and knows her well.\"\n\n- Francis-Henri Graffard, trainer of Emoji", "uri": "6085317077", "url": "https://www.livetradingnews.com/poules-dessai-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-french-guineas-176026.html"}], "6085275157": [811617306, {"sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "published_on": "2020-05-29T16:53:00Z", "name": "Airtel Africa PLC : 2020 Annual Report and Notice of AGM", "dtype": "news", "pk": 811617306, "text": "The 2020 Annual Report and Notice of Annual General Meeting\n\nAirtel Africa plc (the \"Company\") announces that its Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2020 (the \"Annual Report\"), Notice of Annual General Meeting (the \"AGM\"), and Form of Proxy for the AGM have each been sent to shareholders, under the cover of a letter from our Chairman, Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal.\n\nThe Annual Report, Notice of AGM and Chairman's Letter are available to view or download from the Company's website at https://airtel.africa/investors\n\nThe Company's AGM will be held at 11.00 am on 24 June 2020 at First Floor, 53/54 Grosvenor Street, London, W1K 3HU.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT IN LINE WITH UK GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE AT THE TIME OF PUBLICATION OF THE NOTICE OF AGM, which preclude public gatherings and restrict non-essential travel, shareholders must not attend the AGM venue in person.

This allows a consistent approach to risk identification across Airtel Africa.\n\nStrategic risks\n\nExternal risks such as changes in market dynamics or risks to strategic partnerships\n\nFinancial risks\n\nRisks impacting our liquidity or solvency, financial reporting or capital structure\n\nOperational risks\n\nRisks affecting our ability to effectively operate our business model across a variety of functional areas\n\nGovernance and compliance risks\n\nRisks affecting our ability to comply with our legal, regulatory and governance obligations\n\nOur principal risks are those with the most significant potential impact on the achievement of our overall strategic objectives. This list of 14 principal risks is drawn from our consolidated risk register, based on how likely each is to occur and its potential business impact.\n\nWin with customers * Win with data * Win with mobile money\n\nWe operate in an increasingly competitive environment across our markets and segments, particularly with respect to pricing and market share. Aggressive competition by existing players or the entry of a new player could put a downward pressure on prices, adversely affecting our revenue and margins, as well as our profitability and long-term survival. The nature and level of the competition we face varies for each of our markets, products and services. Likelihood = likely. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Ongoing monitoring of competitive landscape and competitor activities\n\n2. Driving penetration of bundle offerings to lock in customers, increase affordability and reduce churn\n\n3. Growing Airtel Money penetration as a tool for customer stickiness\n\n4. Simplifying customer experience through self-care and other customer touchpoints\n\nWe operate an outsourced business model, and our ability to deliver value for our stakeholders could be impacted by factors such as over-reliance on certain vendors, poor governance processes, non-adherence to service level agreements, or a general lack of accountability by our partners. Our business model relies on third-party suppliers and technology providers to manage, maintain and operate our network and IT infrastructure.\n\nEffective governance of our key equipment and technology providers is important to prevent any adverse effect on our business operations. Likelihood = possible. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1.Continuous monitoring of partner performance and strengthening of partner governance capabilities\n\n2. Ongoing review of our strategic vendor landscape across markets and critical business processes to mitigate any long-term continuity risks arising from possible over-dependence on particular vendors\n\nWin with customers * Win with data * Win with mobile money\n\nOur industry is continually facing pressure from non-conventional and over-the-top (OTT) players (internet-based alternatives to traditional telephony services) which provide similar services for our customers. We need to innovate to simplify our user experience, make our business processes more agile, and develop more digital touchpoints to reach our customers and meet their changing needs. These innovations are necessary to avoid the risk of losing customers. Likelihood = likely. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Setting up the Airtel development centre as a hub for our digitisation initiatives\n\n2. Simplifying our core IT systems and integration capabilities to allow for faster deployment of new products and services and integration with third-party applications\n\n3. Rolling out various digital apps in some of our key markets\n\nThe novel COVID-19 pandemic has paralysed the global economy, causing massive disruptions in the movement of people and the global supply chain, and adversely impacted the cash flow and liquidity of businesses. Despite the adverse effects of the pandemic, demand for telecommunications services, especially fixed and mobile internet, has increased as more people work from home and require the internet to connect to their work network. Telecommunication services are considered an essential service. However, the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Group's ability to operate its business effectively and achieve its objectives. Likelihood = likely. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Implementation of business continuity plans for all functions and operating subsidiaries within the Group to ensure minimal disruption of our abilities to provide critical telecom services during this period\n\n2. Set-up of a crisis management centre for the Group with daily and weekly reviews at three layers: crisis management teams at the OpCo level, crisis management team at the Group office providing oversight over the OpCo crisis management teams, and the Executive Committee providing overall oversight\n\n3. Ongoing engagement with relevant regulatory bodies inour operating markets to designate telecom companiesas providers of essential services. This has allowed us to continue to operate our retail stores, and maintain our telecoms infrastructure and the movement of essential employees during lockdowns in some markets\n\n4. To protect the health and safety of our employees, the Group has activated its work from home policy irrespective of local governments' lockdown restrictions, and instituted various measures.\n\nThe company has partnered with relevant health agencies in our operating markets to support the governments' response to the pandemic\n\nWin with data * Win with mobile money * Win with network * Win with customers * Win with cost\n\nAn inability to effectively and efficiently invest and upgrade our network and IT infrastructure would affect our ability to compete effectively in the market. While we continually invest in improving and maintaining our networks and IT systems to address current levels of volume and capacity growth, we need to continue to commit substantial capital to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and the competitive landscape. Likelihood = possible. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Refreshing our IT infrastructure with focus on cloud technology\n\n2. Network modernisation project involving upgrades to our core (mobile switching) and packet (mobile data) networks\n\n3. Reducing the cost of network operations by adopting radio agnostic technology, 'single RAN', which allows easy switching of network resources and spectrum between 2G, 3G and 4G networks at minimal marginal costs\n\nWin with customers * Win with data * Win with network * Win with mobile money\n\nCybersecurity threats through internal or external sabotage or system vulnerabilities could potentially result in customer data breaches and/or service downtimes. Like any other business, we are increasingly exposed to the risk that third parties or malicious insiders may attempt to use cyber-crime techniques, including distributed denial of service attacks, to disrupt the availability, confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems. This could disrupt our key operations, make it difficult to recover critical services and damage our assets. Likelihood = likely. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Rolling out a security and cyber awareness training programme using various channels\n\n2. Ongoing reviews and updates to our information security policy\n\n3. Continuing to identify risk and assess vulnerability\n\nTo maintain our profitability, we need to keep our cost structure in check. Increases in costs relative to the growth in revenues are a threat to our profitability. Our operating costs are subject to fluctuations, including in response to changes in global commodity prices, market uncertainty, energy costs (such as diesel and electricity), and the cost of obtaining and maintaining licences, spectrum and other regulatory requirements. Prevailing macroeconomic conditions and a variety of other factors beyond our control also contribute to this risk. We need to continually re-evaluate our operating model and cost structure to identify innovative ways to optimise our costs. Likelihood = likely. Impact = moderate.\n\n1. Continuing to review opportunities to refine our operating model to further optimise costs\n\n2. Rolling out various initiatives to optimise our operating structure to improve business performance\n\nWin with data * Win with mobile money * Win with network * Win with customers * Win with people * Win with cost\n\nWe need to continually identify and develop successors for key leadership positions across our organisation to ensure minimal disruption to the execution of our corporate strategy. Our ability to execute our business strategies depends in large part on the efforts of our key people. In some of the countries in which we operate, there's a shortage of skilled telecommunications professionals. Any failure to successfully recruit, train, integrate, retain and motivate key skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, the results of our operations, financial condition and prospects. = possible. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Defined functional and leadership development plans for the leadership and critical roles within Airtel Africa\n\n2. Put talent management processes in place to identity high potential people for development\n\n3. The operation of long-term incentive arrangements structured to encourage employee retention and to align with the long-term objectives of the company\n\nWin with data * Win with mobile money * Win with network * Win with customers * Win with people * Win with cost\n\nGaps in our internal control and compliance environment could affect our reputation and lead to financial losses. Our financial reporting is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in internal or external conditions, new accounting requirements, or delays or inaccuracies in reporting. We continue to implement internal risk management and reporting procedures at Group and OpCo levels to protect against risks of internal control weaknesses and inadequate control over financial reporting. Likelihood = possible. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Strengthening the Group's internal controls over financial reporting and compliance processes\n\n2. Implementing a rigorous review process for addressing findings from internal audit, with oversight from the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nOur ability to provide unparalleled quality of service to our customers and meet quality of service (QoS) requirements depends on the robustness and resilience of our network and IT infrastructure and our ability to respond appropriately to any disruptions. Our telecommunications networks are subject to risks of technical failures, aging infrastructure, human error, wilful acts of destruction or natural disasters. This can include equipment failures, energy or fuel shortages, software errors, damage to fibres, lack of redundancy plans and inadequate disaster recovery plans. Likelihood = likely. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Implementing geographically redundant disaster recovery sites for our networks and IT infrastructure across our OpCos\n\n2. Establishing a governance process for the regular testing of fallback plans for all network and IT systems\n\nOur multinational footprint means we're constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations and the macroeconomic conditions in the markets where we operate. Currency depreciation puts pressure on our liquidity and overall profitability. We derive revenue and incur costs in local currencies where we operate, but we also incur costs in foreign currencies, mainly from buying equipment and services from manufacturers and technology service providers. That means adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in our OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on our liquidity and financial condition. Likelihood = likely. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Renegotiating Forex denominated contracts to local currency contracts\n\n2. Hedging foreign currency denominated payables and loans, and matching assets and liabilities, where possible\n\nWin with data * Win with mobile money * Win with network * Win with customers * Win with people * Win with cost\n\nThe Group has certain debt notes issued by Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group and guaranteed by the Group's majority shareholder. These debt notes contain covenants which could trigger an early repayment in the event of a default by the group's majority shareholder. The outstanding 2023 debt note of $505m contains a covenant that could restrict certain major subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness unless the majority shareholder meets a designated consolidated indebtedness to underlying EBITDA ratio. This covenant is suspended when the notes become designated as investment grade. These cross-guaranteed debt notes and covenants mean that the Group could be adversely impacted by any material uncertainty affecting its majority shareholder if the Group is unable to refinance these debt notes in a timely fashion or on acceptable terms. Likelihood = possible. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Obtaining a standalone credit rating for Airtel Africa plc from global credit rating agencies to enable access to the capital market\n\n2. Creating a Finance committee, a sub-committee of the Audit and Risk Committee, to oversee significant matters relating to treasury, tax and other financing decisions\n\n3. Making committed and non-committed debt facilities available to address any short-term funding needs\n\n4. Reviewing any material development potentially impacting our major shareholder's ability to comply with debt note covenants\n\nWin with data * Win with mobile money * Win with network * Win with customers * Win with people * Win with cost\n\nWe operate in a diverse and dynamic legal and regulatory environment. Establishing and maintaining adequate procedures, systems and controls enables us to comply with our obligations in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are required to comply with data privacy, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, sanctions, and other laws and regulations. A failure to comply could lead to unanticipated regulatory penalties and sanctions or tax levies, as well as damage to our reputation. Likelihood = likely. Impact = moderate.\n\nMitigation\n\n1.Instituting various policies across the Group to comply with the legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate\n\n2. Implementing an escalation process for reporting significant matters to the Group office\n\n3. Communicating with and training employees on relevant company policies\n\nKnow your customer (KYC) and Quality of service (QoS) non-compliance\n\nLink to strategy\n\nWin with data * Win with mobile money * Win with network * Win with customers * Win with people * Win with cost\n\nAs we operate in a large number of jurisdictions, we must comply with an extensive range of laws and regulations relating to the licensing, construction and operation of telecommunications networks and services. Focus on KYC and QoS regulations across our operating markets has increased in recent years. Regulators in several of the countries in which we operate have introduced stringent regulations and guidelines in relation to KYC and maintaining a certain quality of service. A failure to comply could lead to unanticipated regulatory penalties and sanctions and tax levies, and damage to our reputation. Likelihood = likely. Impact = significant.\n\nMitigation\n\n1. Implementing a regular compliance tracking process against KYC requirements, identifying root causes for cases of non-compliance and taking corrective actions\n\n2. Continuing to engage with regulators on quality parameters in certain markets\n\nThere are also a number of global risks which we keep under review. While we don't consider them principal risks, we monitor developments in these areas to determine if we need to elevate their risk rating. These include:\n\nClimate change - we continue to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on our business operations and on the economies in which we operate. It is clear that water scarcity, changing crop patterns, extreme weather events and other climate-related matters could have a range of impacts on the populations we serve, and therefore on our business, in the medium term.

Heading the new team will be incoming President Gabriele Kotsis. Kotsis is Professor and Head of the Department of Telecooperation at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria. Joining Kotsis as Vice President will be Joan Feigenbaum, Grace Murray Hopper Professor of Computer Science at Yale University; and, as Secretary/Treasurer, Elisa Bertino, Samuel Conte Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University.\n\nIn addition, Members-at-Large elected to four-year terms are Nancy M. Amato, Abel Bliss Professor and Department Head of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Tom Crick, Professor of Digital Education & Policy, Swansea University, Swansea, UK; Susan Dumais, Technical Fellow and Director, Microsoft Research Labs, New England; Mehran Sahami, Professor (Teaching) and Associate Chair for Education, Stanford University; and Alejandro Saucedo, Engineering Director (Machine Learning), Seldon Technologies and Chief Scientist, The Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning, London, UK.\n\nPresident-elect Kotsis said her key priorities include using ACM's global reach and the expertise of its membership to address pressing problems in society. \"No other discipline or technology will have more impact on shaping our future than computer science and technology,\" said Kotsis. \"Global problems must be addressed in a global way, independently from a particular individual, national or commercial interest. Computing can play a role in fighting the CO2 dilemma, fertilizing medical research and healthcare, and protecting our democracy.\" Kotsis also emphasized that ACM must continue to be a leading voice for fostering ethics in the field. \"Our community must lead, not only from a scientific and technical perspective in being able to provide correct solutions, but also from an ethical and societal point of view,\" she added.\n\nKotsis is a founding member of the ACM Europe Council, serving from 2008 to 2016. She has organized ACM conferences and workshops, and in 2016 received an award in appreciation of her accomplishments regarding the ACM womENcourage conference series. In 2014, she became an ACM Distinguished Member for her contributions to workload characterization for parallel and distributed systems, and for founding ACM Europe. Since 2016, she has been an elected Member-at-Large of the ACM Council.\n\nJoan Feigenbaum, incoming ACM Vice President, echoed Kotsis's vision for ACM to play an active role in utilizing computing to foster a better future. \"ACM members can address myriad threats now facing society,\" said Feigenbaum. \"These threats combine sophisticated computation in critical ways with politics (as in 'election hacking'), economics (as in technology-induced unemployment), journalism (as in 'fake news'), law (as in mass surveillance in the name of national security), international relations (as in 'cyberwar'), finance (as in bitcoin speculation), and many other fields. In tackling them, computer scientists will work collaboratively with people in social sciences, law, and many disciplines besides the STEM fields with which we have collaborated for decades.\"\n\nA member of ACM since graduate school, Feigenbaum has served in many roles, including SIGACT Executive Committee member from 2005 to 2009 and SIGEcom Vice Chair from 2005 to 2011. During her tenure with SIGEcom, she played a leading role in establishing ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation (TEAC). Most recently, she led the creation of the ACM Symposium on Computer Science and Law and served as General Chair for the inaugural symposium in 2019.\n\nNewly-elected ACM Secretary/Treasurer Elisa Bertino, an ACM member for 38 years, would like ACM to be a leading voice in areas including AI and data ethics, data transparency, and sustainability. \"I will also focus on important matters, such as broadening diversity in our field, supporting younger researchers and open access to data and publications,\" said Bertino. \"Last, but not least, I would like to make sure that ACM stays technically relevant by organizing workshops and conferences on new emerging technologies and applications.\"\n\nBertino served as Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing and coordinating Co-Editor-in-Chief of Very Large Database Systems (VLDB). She chaired ACM's Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC) from 2009 to 2013. In 2011, she co-founded ACM's Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY), now considered the main forum for high-quality research on data privacy and security. She is the recipient of the 2019-2020 ACM Athena Lecturer Award.\n\nAbout ACM\n\nACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, uniting computing educators, researchers and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources and address the field's challenges.

This will lead to assessment and payment of appropriate stamp duties and a consequential issuance of a stamp duty certificate or an acknowledgement.\n\n\"Such certificate or acknowledgement will suffice as evidence that stamp duties have been paid and that the electronic receipt has been stamped appropriately.\"\n\nThe agency adds that \"all electronic dutiable instruments or receipts\", including e-mails, short message service (sms), instant messages (IM), any internet-based messaging service, are subject to stamp duty.\n\nThe circular, issued in April, clearly stated that \"all printed receipts\" and \"all electronically generated receipts and any form of electronic acknowledgement of money for dutiable transactions\" are liable to duty payment.\n\nPWC FAULTS ENFORCEMENT\n\nIn its analysis of the circular, PwC Nigeria said a major issue with the Stamp Duties Act (SDA) in its current form is the \"practicability of enforcing compliance\".\n\n\"The practical application of this is doubtful and even where the FIRS attempts to enforce this, taxpayers may challenge the FIRS' definition of the term, as the Act itself does not provide a definition.\n\n\"While the Circular encourages the payment of stamp duties via the FIRS' e-platform, there have been complaints that the platform does not facilitate bulk remittance of stamp duties, as the platform only allows individual stamping of documents. The FIRS should address this.\n\n\"In general, the SDA (enacted in 1939) needs to be repealed and re-enacted to be in tune with modern day business and economic realities.\"\n\nThe Finance Act (FA) 2019 introduced some amendments to the Stamp Duties Act (SDA) which necessitated this recent circular by the FIRS.\n\nIn line with the amended SDA, a N50 stamp duty is payable on any bank deposit or transfer of N10,000 or more, except deposits or transfers between accounts maintained by the same person in the same bank.\n\nClick to signup for FREE news updates, latest information and hottest gists everyday\n\nAdvertise on NigerianEye.com to reach thousands of our daily readers", "uri": "6085310000", "url": "http://www.nigerianeye.com/2020/05/nigerians-will-now-pay-stamp-duty-on.html"}], "6085287017": [520979641, {"sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:05:00Z", "name": "Broadband expansion in Midlands county part of statewide connectivity push", "dtype": "news", "pk": 520979641, "text": "COLUMBIA -- A broadband expansion project by a Midlands power company into outlying areas of a built-out South Carolina county is being held up as an example of the digital disparities present even in parts of the state considered urban.\n\nTri-County Electric Cooperative, a St. Matthews energy provider for six counties, is planning to run high-speed internet lines into rural pockets of Richland County within several months as part of a systemwide upgrade taking shape over the next few years, utility officials said on Wednesday.\n\nCOVID-19 New maps spotlight where SC residents have no way to access internet By Mary Katherine Wildeman mkwildeman@postandcourier.com\n\nDetails of the plan were made public just as the state's coronavirus recovery panel proposed that Gov.

Last month, a Gov. Henry McMaster-appointed task force suggested placing a \"high priority\" on using COVID-19 recovery funds to plug that gap ahead of the 2020-21 academic year.\n\nOf the state's 81 school districts, 19 are completely online and 45 are using a mix of virtual and paper instruction, depending on the home and community access to high-speed internet. But in 17 districts, teaching continues entirely through packets either picked up at the school or taken to students' homes, according to the state Education Department.\n\n\"We've got places less than 10 miles from here where folks don't have broadband,\" state Superintendent Molly Spearman said on April 27, during the first coronavirus recovery task force meeting. \"It's not just Allendale. It's all over. I need your help. This is out of my realm, if we're going to be able to offer e-leaning to all students, but also telehealth and tele-mental health.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Pro Tem Tommy Pope, of York, said the problem is much more complex than people realize, as it's not just a rural-urban issue.\n\nEven in his district, teachers have called him about the lack of broadband at their home: \"Have we figured out mechanically what (providing broadband statewide) really entails? I have a teacher where it's available at the front of the street but it's not financially feasible (for the provider) to extend to the end of the street,\" Pope said.\n\nSpearman agreed, noting she received a similar call from a teacher in Spartanburg County. \"A teacher teaching AP calculus and had to go to her church to get internet. It was a situation where broadband was 900 feet from her home.\"\n\nSpearman's department has tried to solve that problem by deploying 400 Wi-Fi-equipped school buses to regions of the state where internet is lacking, creating traveling hot spots that students can use to complete course work.\n\nSeanna Adcox contributed to this report.\n\nBusiness Feds, Home Telecom to invest $16M on rural SC broadband upgrades By Mary Katherine Wildeman mkwildeman@postandcourier.com", "uri": "6085287017", "url": "https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/broadband-expansion-in-midlands-county-part-of-statewide-connectivity-push/article_7dfd03b6-9f6c-11ea-97fa-7367b4989f5c.html"}], "6085314751": [271705515, {"sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:30:00Z", "name": "Alec Baldwin to Star in Joel Souza's Action Western 'Rust'", "dtype": "news", "pk": 271705515, "text": "The actor will also produce the film that will have its sales launched at the upcoming March\u00e9 du Film Online\n\nAlec Baldwin is set to star in Joel Souza's \"Rust,\" which he will also produce under his El Dorado Pictures banner, the Highland Film Group announced on Friday.\n\nBaldwin will produce alongside Anjul Nigam and and executive producer Matthew Helderman.

PetroTal continues to monitor this situation closely, and based on discussions with Petroperu, expect that in July 2020, the oil sales pipeline will re-open allowing for Bretana oil field operations to recommence;PetroTal announced on May 7, 2020 a contingent liability under the Company's oil swap and sales arrangements with Petroperu, of approximately $42 million as at March 31, 2020 arising from the drop in global oil prices. As a result of the recent recovery in oil prices, the Company estimates that the contingent liability has decreased to approximately $35 million as of May 28, 2020. The ultimate liability will not be crystallized until Q3 and Q4 2020, when the physical oil sales materialize. The Company is in discussions to facilitate an arrangement whereby the contingent liability, when crystallized, will be settled over a three-year period from future cash flow, and;As announced on May 7, 2020, PetroTal continues to assess a variety of financial arrangements to ensure it has the necessary funding for its operations. When finalized, the Company will update the market.\n\nABOUT PETROTAL\n\nPetroTal is a publicly-traded, dual-quoted (TSXV: TAL) and (AIM: PTAL) oil and gas development and production company domiciled in Calgary, Alberta, focused on the development of oil assets in Peru. PetroTal's flagship asset is the Breta\u00f1a oil field in Peru's Block 95 where oil production was initiated in June 2018, six months after acquisition. Additionally, the Company has large exploration prospects and is engaged in finding a partner to drill the Osheki prospect in Block 107. The Company's management team has significant experience in developing and exploring for oil in Northern Peru and is led by a Board of Directors that is focused on safely and cost effectively developing the Breta\u00f1a oil field.\n\nFor further information, please see the Company's website at www.petrotal-corp.com, the Company's filed documents at www.sedar.com, or contact:\n\nDouglas Urch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nDurch@PetroTal-Corp.com\n\nT: (713) 609-9101\n\nManolo Zuniga\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nMzuniga@PetroTal-Corp.com\n\nT: (713) 609-9101\n\nCelicourt Communications\n\nMark Antelme / Jimmy Lea\n\npetrotal@celicourt.uk\n\nT: 44 (0) 208 434 2643\n\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated & Financial Adviser)\n\nJames Spinney / Ritchie Balmer\n\nT: 44 (0) 207 409 3494\n\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Joint Broker)\n\nCallum Stewart / Simon Mensley / Ashton Clanfield\n\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7710 7600\n\nNumis Securities Limited (Joint Broker)\n\nJohn Prior / Emily Morris\n\nT: +44 (0) 207 260 1000\n\nREADER ADVISORIES\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release contains certain statements that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Such statements relate to possible future events, including, but not limited to: PetroTal's business strategy, objectives, strength and focus; the Company's ability to operate in accordance with developing public health efforts to contain COVID-19; the timing of filing the Annual Filings and the Interim Filings; the timing of the Company's next annual shareholder meeting. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward- looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"potential\", \"will\", \"should\", \"continue\", \"may\", \"objective\" and similar expressions. The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the Company. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e. g. , operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses; and health, safety and environmental risks), commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, legal, political and economic instability in Peru, access to transportation routes and markets for the Company's production, changes in legislation affecting the oil and gas industry and uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures. In addition, the Company cautions that current global uncertainty with respect to the spread of the COVID-19 virus and its effect on the broader global economy may have a significant negative effect on the Company. While the precise impact of the COVID-19 virus on the Company remains unknown, rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic activity, and may continue to result in volatility and disruption to global supply chains, operations, mobility of people and the financial markets, which could affect interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, inflation, business, financial conditions, results of operations and other factors relevant to the Company. Please refer to the risk factors identified in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2018 and management's discussion and analysis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

Yakubu Gowon, who gave Prof Adedeji the 'command' to undertake with Mr Kodjo, the diplomatic shuttles and groundwork, that culminated in the signing of the Lagos Treaty by an unprecedented number of regional Heads of State at one sitting.\n\nThis was despite the stout resistance by France and some regional leaders, especially the late Ivorian President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, who had instead supported the formation of a France-Afrique union. The ECOWAS idea prevailed with a compromise under which Cote d'Ivoire's Aboubakar Diaby Ouatarra was appointed as the first Executive Secretary.\n\nECOWAS' core agenda under the founding and revised treaties underscore the fostering of economic integration. Gen Gowon in an interview during celebration to mark ECOWAS at 40, noted: \"There were niggling challenges (including colonial history, cultural and language differences), but thanks to the determination and political will of the leaders at that time, virtually all the member States were represented and signed the Lagos Treaty,\" with economic and social integration as the primary concern then.\n\nBut for almost two decades, including what is often referred to as the 'lost decade' (the late 1970s to the 1980s), and even up to early 21st Century, ECOWAS was bogged down with fighting political fires in a region, then notorious for military coup d'\u00e9tats. Of note were the conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau, and later Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire and other countries.\n\nIn 1990, the military juntas in Nigeria and Ghana with the support of a few other regional leaders set up the regional peacekeeping force, the ECOWAS Peace Monitoring Group (ECOMOG).\n\nUnder ECOWAS leadership, the United Nations later joined the interventions by deploying its peace Missions. Some level of political stability was then restored in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire, but at huge costs in human lives, property, displacements of millions of people and financial losses.\n\nAlthough the wave of pluralistic democracy that swept across the African continent in 1990s actually started in the ECOWAS region (Benin), the region is still bedevilled by socio-economic and political upheavals.\n\nToday all the 15 ECOWAS nations are practising the democratic system of government with levels of imperfection. And in the words of Prof Adedeji in a 2015 interview at his Ijebu-Ode town in Western Nigeria: \"ECOWAS (remains) the only region in Africa where citizens can visit and stay in a country other than their own for at least 90 days without a visa.\"\n\nThis was in reference to the ECOWAS 1979 flagship Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, Rights to Residence and Establishment. Also in 1979, the region adopted the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS) to promote cooperation, regional economic integration and common market.\n\nTo revamp the organisation's normative instruments, the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State issued the Declaration on Political Principles in 1991 reaffirming the Community's commitment to democracy and free market.\n\nAnd in response to emerging financial challenges, the ECOWAS Revised Treaty of 1993 prescribed the 0.5% Community Levy payable by member States, on imports from third party countries. This has since become a major source of income for the ECOWAS Commission (formerly Executive Secretariat), effectively replacing the unsustainable and irregular annual contributions.\n\nThe Revised Treaty also addressed issues of political governance, sustainable peace and security in the region, resulting in several instruments including the 1999 Protocol relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peacekeeping and Security (or the Mechanism). Indeed, this inspired the adoption of a similar Mechanism by the African Union several years later.\n\nArticle 25 of the ECOWAS Mechanism provided for the creation of a regional Mediation and Security Council and peace and security interventions, including preventive diplomacy.\n\nThis was followed two years later by the adoption of the Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance, which sets minimum constitutional convergence criteria for ECOWAS membership based on shared values of democracy and a free market, separation of powers, popular participation, democratic control of the armed forces, and guarantees of basic freedoms.\n\nAnother key provision of the protocol is 'zero tolerance' for power obtained or maintained by unconstitutional means. This was followed in 2008 with the adoption of the ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework (ECPF) to recalibrate the regional peace and security architecture.\n\nIn enforcing the zero-tolerance clause of the Supplementary Protocol, ECOWAS has exerted impactful pressure on 'wayward regimes' to change their ways through a combination of sanctions and preventive diplomacy. Between 2009 and 2011, three member States - Guinea, Niger and Cote d'Ivoire - were suspended for violating the Protocol.\n\nThe ECOWAS Commission under the leadership of Ambassador James Victor Gbeho also refused to send observers to The Gambia's presidential election in 2011 and withheld recognition of the result of that election in which the now-deposed President Yaya Jammeh claimed victory.\n\nEarlier, under Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the ECOWAS Commission had resisted an attempt by Niger's former President Mamadou Tandja to elongate his tenure with a dubious constitutional change through a botched referendum in 2009.\n\nIndeed, ECOWAS has been able to restore constitutional order and legality, supported peace and security and the conduct of credible elections in its member States, working unilaterally or in partnership with the international community - African Union, United Nations System, especially the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), now headed by Dr Chambas, European Union, German Development Agency (GIZ -Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit), Danish Agency for International Development (DANIDA), World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA), West Africa Network for Peace building (WANEP), and several other organisations and nations.\n\nEven today, ECOWAS military missions are in The Gambia and Guinea Bissau on peace and security duty.\n\nThere has also been some progress in infrastructure development, in regional roads, environment, electricity/energy Power Pool and Gas Pipeline projects, and other Community programmes, as well as in gender and humanitarian affairs synergy, collaboration on electoral matters through the ECOWAS Network of Electoral Commissions (ECONEC) and the ECOWAS electoral assistance to member States.\n\nThe organisation continues its efforts to reconcile differences with the EU on the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which is designed to replace the old Cotonou Accord between the two regions and open up markets for reciprocal commercial exchanges. These are all commendable efforts.\n\nHowever, with the rash of governance challenges in several member States, especially over electoral disputes and the tendency for the ruling political parties to manipulate national constitutions either for presidential tenure elongations or in favour of the government in power, and the intolerance of opposition, many political observers believe that ECOWAS should be more proactive and assertive.\n\nThis can be done by leveraging existing instruments including sanctions and suspension of erring member States as happened in not too distant past.\n\nFor instance, there are festering political disputes in some member States such as Benin, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Togo, The Gambia, Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, to name but a few, which must be addressed before they escalate into major conflicts or civil wars, that the region can ill-afford at this time.\n\nAlso, with the on-going global financial crisis worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, ECOWAS leaders must take the sustainability of the regional organisation more seriously.\n\nFor instance, the transformation of the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat to a Commission in 2007, with all its good intentions would seem to have created room for wastage. That move was reportedly in line with the African Union Commission and the European Commission structure.\n\nIronically, ECOWAS is older than the African Union Commission which came into existence in 2002, and the European Commission is now effectively emphasising its unity through the nomenclature of the European Union. ECOWAS, too, should be moving towards greater union consistent with its motto of an 'ECOWAS of People and not ECOWAS of States.'\n\nInitially, seven Commissioners plus a Vice President and President were contemplated for the ECOWAS Commission. But it now has 15 Commissioners with the attendant huge increase in personnel and running costs and the unhelpful tendency of some Commissioners operating in silos, protecting national interests at the expense of the Community goal.\n\nSome of these statutory appointees allegedly take directives from their home governments in dealing with Community matters and therefore see the organisation as 'a regional cake.' Despite the eyebrows raised two years ago, the 15 Commissioners are still in place and with the global financial crisis exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic; many countries have been hit hard, including oil-producing regional economic power Nigeria, ECOWAS' major financial contributor.\n\nThe implication is that ECOWAS could face dire financial strait, similar to its experience in the 1990s when the Executive Secretariat was unable to pay staff salaries. The AU does not have a Commissioner for each of its 54 member States and neither does the EU, which can afford it.\n\nWith ECOWAS statutory positions rotated, increasing the number of Commissioners to 15, even with unlimited resources makes no economic sense. But if all its member States should insist on having Commissioners at the same time, perhaps every member should separately foot the bill, as once suggested.\n\nThis will save the organisation the unnecessary financial burden of additional staff salaries and other financial implications of an expanded structure, including new directorates, office space and equipment, and additional running costs.\n\nAnother area of serious concern in ECOWAS' survival is its unsatisfactory stride toward achieving a common market and a single monetary union, which are critical to regional economic integration.\n\nFrance, acting in collaboration with Cote d'Ivoire, has effectively hijacked the ECOWAS proposed currency name, Eco, to replace the CFA franc, used by former French colony member States in ECOWAS.\n\nWhile ECOWAS has been slow on its single currency programme, which was to come into effect next July after several postponements, the move by Paris and its allies is not only condescendingly audacious, but also smacks of a ploy to undermine the ECOWAS integration agenda.\n\nThere are a thousand and one names they could have chosen. The substitution of CFA with Eco also leaves much to be desired, because it appears driven by the ruling class without public support. France will still have a strangle hold on the economy and financial destiny of its former colonies and like with the CFA franc, the exchange rate of the proposed Eco would also be pegged to the Euro.\n\nBy and large, ECOWAS could be justifiably proud that today, due to its interventions including preventive diplomacy, democratic culture is gradually taking root in the region with incumbents losing elections to oppositions. Still, peace and security remain fragile in the region.\n\nGoing forward, the regional economic grouping must rediscover its teeth/assertiveness in holding its leaders and member States accountable to the instruments and protocols they have signed and/or ratified. After 45 years of existence, it is not enough for ECOWAS to be basking in past glory, because to whom much is given, much is also expected.\n\nProf. Adedeji had during the Ijebu-Ode interview, made a passionate appeal to ECOWAS member States to work towards the harmonisation of policies, laws and regulations to consolidate regional integration, as envisaged by the founding fathers. Even more optimistic and with justifiable reason is Gen. Gowon, who is advocating a West African government to serve as a building block for the proposed United States of Africa.\n\nBut it takes an unwavering commitment, determination, persistence and concrete actions to turn dreams into reality!", "uri": "6085314191", "url": "https://elombah.com/ecowas-at-45-and-the-dream-of-its-founding-fathers/"}], "6085314114": [583859692, {"sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:32:00Z", "name": "Alec Baldwin to Play Western Outlaw in 'Rust,' Heading to Cannes Digital Market ", "dtype": "news", "pk": 583859692, "text": "Baldwin is also producing the film, with his 'Crown Vic' collaborator Joel Souza director.\n\nThe first projects heading to Cannes' inaugural digital market have started rolling in, with an Alec Baldwin Western among those saddling up for buyers.\n\nThe Oscar nominee and 30 Rock star is set to take the lead in Rust, which he is also producing under his El Dorado Pictures banner alongside Anjul Nigam (Never Have I Ever) and executive producer Matthew Helderman.

Scholars have recognized that the modern-day control of social, economic, political and cultural aspects of former colonies by modern powers is still happening. They call it \"neocolonialism.\"\n\nAs public health experts who have worked extensively on global health issues, we've been struck by how this neocolonialist attitude has played out in this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization has sent a message to every country in the world during this pandemic: \"Test, test, test.\"\n\nBut not every country felt the message was meant for them. In mid-March the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. Yet at a press conference, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, stated that the WHO guidelines did not apply to the UK's \"extremely well-developed public health system.'\" She explained that WHO's recommended approach for all countries were actually meant more for lower income countries.\n\nNeedless to say, that philosophy did not stick.\n\nThe government now recommends widespread testing and in fact set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the U.K. by the end of April.\n\nThe U.K. and other onetime colonial powers did not turn to their former colonies or to the East for advice - although they should have.\n\nAfrican and Asian countries have had far more experience dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS than the United States and the countries of Europe. But neocolonialism relies on the continued belief that former colonial rulers are superior in terms of expertise and societal values. Not only are such attitudes racist and xenophobic, they're illogical.\n\nAnd it represents a kind of overconfidence that has literally been deadly. There was public knowledge of a viral respiratory epidemic threat from China in January, yet serious nationwide public health responses in the U.S. and U.K. did not start until March 2020.\n\nEven once it became clear that wealthy countries were at risk, there was a widespread reluctance to learn from China and from other Asian countries.\n\nThe American reaction focused instead on blaming China - consider President Trump's use of the term \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nChina was further criticized for using draconian measures when millions of people in Wuhan were put under lockdown - even though the countries of the West that denigrated such tactics might today be better off if they had acted similarly.\n\nIndeed, recent data suggests that the majority of cases in the United States came from New York City. Restricting travel out of the city, as was done in Wuhan, might have meant far fewer cases in the U.S.\n\nAnd while Trump put an early ban on much travel from China, effective Feb. 1, he delayed any travel bans from European countries even as the virus toll mounted until mid-March. Today, we know that most of the cases in the eastern U.S. were of European origin.\n\nThen there is the matter of face masks.\n\nAt first the U.S. made it seem as if wearing masks was based on superstition and had no benefit. So the message was that the mask-wearing citizens of China and other Asian countries were being foolish. As late as Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.\n\nBut the data is showing that universal masking could dramatically curb transmission. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did in fact change its earlier view and endorse the public use of cloth masks. To us, the hesitancy to adopt universal masking in public has been another example of Western arrogance.\n\nWhat's more, even former colonies are influenced by neocolonialism in the way they make decisions.\n\nSome of the solutions that work in the West are being imported by lower-income countries without consideration to whether they can work and what unforeseen consequences there might be.\n\nIt's one thing for a country like Italy, Spain or the U.K. to call for a full-country lockdown. Many workers can switch to at-home work and not lose income. But in countries with widespread poverty, a lockdown immediately means the end of income for street vendors, construction workers and many others who earn their living day-by-day - and the very real threat of hunger as their income evaporates.\n\nAnother argument for lockdowns is that if fewer people become ill, health-care systems will not be overwhelmed and will have time to acquire the equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nBut in low-income settings, that kind of gearing up is much harder to accomplish. They already have far fewer ventilators, ICU-level beds and critical-care trained doctors.\n\nAnd the government doesn't necessarily have the ability to finance that kind of scaling up. One reason, in our opinion, is the nature of so-called \"structural adjustment grants\" offered to low-income countries by the World Bank since the second half of the 20th century. The idea was that the money would be used to build up the private sector rather than to strengthen essential social systems like health care. And these grants have a legacy of ongoing debt that countries are still paying back to this day.\n\nYet in spite of it all, we see some signs of hope - ways that the world is rejecting neocolonialism.\n\nA new attitude is emerging: The idea that countries that have responded to outbreaks for so long have something to teach the West. These countries that battled Ebola already have systems in place to do a job that everyone says is critical for controlling the novel coronavirus: contact tracing. They know how to gather information about all the contacts of a newly diagnosed person and then set up systems to isolate those contacts until the risk of infection has passed. We can and must adopt their expertise here as well - and we are. The state of Massachusetts is collaborating with global health group Partners In Health to use the contact tracing and isolation strategies that were initially honed in the Ebola response in West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also new partnerships to train community health workers, learning from the work of Last Mile Health, which leads such programs in Liberia.\n\nThat's progress - but not enough progress.\n\nThe lessons and expertise of the East and of African countries, coupled with the resources and power of the West, could have allowed us all to fare better. And as COVID-19 spreads globally, we will be called upon to collaborate.\n\nWe need to make sure we answer that call.\n\nAbraar Karan is an internal medicine physician and clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Their household should also start a 14-day isolation period.\n\nIf the test proves negative, everyone can come out of isolation.\n\nBut if the test is positive, NHS contact tracers or local public health teams will phone, email or send a text, asking them to share details of the people they have been in close contact with and places they have visited.\n\nThe team then emails or texts those close contacts, telling them they must stay home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms, to avoid unknowingly spreading the virus.\n\nProf Green told BBC Breakfast: 'I think one of the things that we have to understand is that it's an enormous task to get testing into care homes, and also the testing is not a one-time activity.\n\n'We need a rolling programme of testing, both for residents and also for staff, so this is something that is a huge logistical issue.\n\n'But we have got to get on top of it and we've got to also prioritise care homes because of course it's care homes where the most vulnerable people live, so I really want to see testing ramped up.'\n\nJust 5 per cent of care home residents were tested in the last week, down from 6 per cent in the previous seven-day period, according to figures from The Data Analysis Bureau (T-DAB) and Person Centred Software (PCS).\n\nThe analysis said 38 per cent of care homes have had no residents tested since the pandemic started.\n\nThe data also suggested that fewer than one in 10 (nine per cent) residents have been tested since May 15, when health secretary Matt Hancock announced his pledge for universal care home testing.\n\nSTRICT adherence to government coronavirus lockdown guidelines and overall confidence in government are at all-time lows, new data suggests.\n\nAccording to University College London's (UCL) Covid-19 social study of more than 90,000 adults during the outbreak, 'complete' compliance of government recommendations has decreased in the past two weeks.\n\nIt declined from an average of 70 per cent of people who were completely adhering to just over 50 per cent.\n\nRespondents were also asked how much confidence they had in the government's handling of the Covid-19 epidemic from one (not at all) to seven (lots).\n\nResearchers found there has been a further decrease in confidence in the government in England over the bank holiday weekend -- from around 4 to around 3.5.\n\nConfidence is falling most notably amongst those under 30, those in urban areas and those with a mental health diagnosis.\n\nOther findings from May 18-25 reveal that keyworkers in health and social care show similar experiences to people in lockdown at home, but are less worried about unemployment.\n\nThe dates cover the weekend when news broke that prime minister Boris Johnson's top aide Dominic Cummings (pictured) had driven 260miles to County Durham during the lockdown.\n\nNICOLA STURGEON has urged people in Scotland to be responsible as they enjoy the partial lifting of lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe first minister (pictured) said she is 'not trying to cramp anyone's fun this weekend' as changes allow people to meet family and friends outdoors.\n\nBut she warned the virus could surge again if safety precautions are not observed.\n\nAs of today, people in Scotland can meet one other household at a time outdoors -- though they should continue to socially distance when meeting and the maximum number in the group should be eight.\n\nPeople are also allowed to sit or sunbathe in nearby parks and travel locally for recreation.\n\nFurther changes as the country moves into phase one of the Scottish government's four-part plan for gradually lifting lockdown include outdoor sports such as tennis, golf, bowls and fishing being permitted, and garden centres reopening.\n\nMost outdoor work can resume, construction sites can prepare for work to start again and drive-through restaurants are no longer being discouraged from opening.\n\nMeanwhile, people in Wales will be allowed to meet up with others outdoors from Monday, the first minister has said.\n\nMark Drakeford (pictured) said a relaxing of lockdown rules meant people from two different

He said a decision would be coming within the next few days.\n\nMaui Mayor Mike Victorino said he wants to make sure steps are taken to control the virus.\n\n\"I'm willing to open up with necessary safeguards to prevent spread between islands,\" Victorino said.\n\nThe pandemic has bludgeoned Hawaii's economy, triggering what University of Hawaii economists called \"the sharpest and deepest economic downturn in the state's modern history.\"\n\nHawaii instituted a stay-at-home order and closed dine-in restaurants, shopping malls and other businesses in March to slow the spread of the virus. The state then followed with the traveler quarantine, which effectively shut off the flow of visitors who fuel the state's biggest industry, tourism. Unemployment hit 22.3% in April, among the highest rates in the country.\n\nThe number of travelers arriving in Hawaii fell to 4,564 last month compared to 856,250 in April 2019, the Hawaii Tourism Authority said. That's a 99.5% decline.\n\nThe University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization predicted in a new report the state's gross domestic product will shrink 11.1% this calendar year as spending by travelers plunges 65%. This estimate is based on a calculation that tourists will begin to return to the islands in late July.\n\nA more pessimistic forecast, based on tourists not returning until late September, predicts a 12.9% decline in GDP this year and a 73.5% drop in visitor spending.\n\nThe state is also facing a sharp decline in tax revenue.\n\nThe Council on Revenues, which forecasts tax revenue for the governor and Legislature, on Thursday predicted general fund tax revenue would drop 7% during the fiscal year ending June 30. It expects that to be followed by a 12% drop the subsequent fiscal year.\n\nRep. Sylvia Luke, the chairwoman of the House Finance Committee, said after the forecast was released that she hopes the state will be able to avoid \"massive reductions\" to the budget given work lawmakers have already undertaken to achieve savings like eliminating vacant positions and taking money from special funds.\n\nHer counterpart in the Senate, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sen. Donovan Dela Cruz, said some \"strategic cuts\" would need to be made. He also expressed hope the Ige administration would borrow money from the Federal Reserve's new municipal liquidity facility to cover some of the shortfall. Congress may also appropriate additional aid to states beyond the coronavirus relief funds already awarded, he said.\n\nLawmakers plan to reconvene in mid-June to work further on the budget.\n\nCouncil on Revenues member Jack Suyderhoud, a University of Hawaii professor emeritus, said there was a great deal of uncertainty in the revenue predictions. One unknown is when the state's leaders would move to lift the quarantine requirement, he said.\n\n\"The problem is that we're now in the business of forecasting what the viral science is going to be doing and then we also have to forecast what the politicians are doing. And so it's getting pretty crazy,\" Suyderhoud said during an online broadcast of the meeting.\n\nThe council last issued its forecast on March 11 before the state's stay-at-home order and traveler quarantine took effect. At that point, the council estimated general fund tax revenues would increase 3.8% during the current fiscal year and be flat in the next fiscal year.\n\nHawaii law requires policymakers to consider the council's estimates when drafting state budgets and appropriating funds.

Hence those allocations.\"\n\nMr. Dayant said it is comforting to see the Government focusing on Health given the pandemic exposing alarming weaknesses in the region's health systems.\n\n\"To me, the Ministry appropriations seems adapted to the crisis. It is important to get both the economy on track on the health system working properly.\n\n\"While the amounts put on the table by the Samoan government are impressive, I don't think it will be enough to address the dire financing needs of the country.

Part of this spending is coming back to the economy through the V.A.G.S.T,\" he wrote in an email response.\n\n\"The money to the pensioners should be diverted to the assistance to the households; the pensioners will get their increase from assistance to the household. All citizens should be treated equal under this stimulus package,\" said Savaiinaea.\n\nEconomist and Political Party leader, Afualo Luagalau Dr. Salele Afualo said the budget for financial year 2020-2021 does not reflect an effort from Government to diversify the economy.\n\nIn an interview with the Samoa Observer, Afualo highlighted that apart from normal priorities of health and education, the proposed budget is an \"election budget\".\n\nAfualo pointed out the increased provision for the Ie Samoa Show (Faalelegapepe) of $1 million and $50 per citizen during the 2020 Census and National ID Registration Roll Out.\n\n\"Although that it falls directly along the line of COVID-19 and measles, whereby it needs a really good stimulus package, but so far it does not go far enough to ensure a real commitment,\" he said.\n\n\"I would say the budget is insufficient to warrant for all demands of the economy, different sectors. A lot of other incentives that have been put into the budget, we know for sure that this is an election budget.\"\n\nAfualo also noted that the stimulus package includes too many measures that will have little effect on the national economy.\n\nHe then urged Government to seize the next financial year budget to reprioritise and diversify the economy.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity for the Government to reprioritise other development goals.

Dans 10 % des cas, l'incidence sur l'ensemble du march\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 14 %, ce qui montre que certaines catastrophes climatiques peuvent avoir un effet consid\u00e9rable sur la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. L'ouragan Katrina de 2005, par exemple, a caus\u00e9 les dommages les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s en termes absolus dans notre \u00e9chantillon (1 % du PIB am\u00e9ricain), mais n'a pas eu d'incidence perceptible sur l'indice boursier am\u00e9ricain. En revanche, les inondations en Tha\u00eflande de 2011, qui ont caus\u00e9 les dommages les plus importants par rapport \u00e0 la taille de l'\u00e9conomie concern\u00e9e, ont entra\u00een\u00e9 une chute de 30 % du march\u00e9 boursier pendant 40 jours.\n\nLes caract\u00e9ristiques propres \u00e0 chaque pays comptent. Les pays disposant de plus d'espace budg\u00e9taire seront en mesure de r\u00e9agir rapidement \u00e0 la catastrophe sous la forme d'une aide financi\u00e8re et d'efforts de reconstruction. En outre, des m\u00e9canismes de partage des risques bien d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s, notamment les assurances, permettront de r\u00e9duire ou de redistribuer les pertes dues aux catastrophes et d'en r\u00e9duire les r\u00e9percussions sur les cours des actions int\u00e9rieures .\n\nRisques futurs et \u00e9valuations actuelles\n\nLe changement climatique devrait accro\u00eetre la probabilit\u00e9 et la gravit\u00e9 de nombreux al\u00e9as climatiques tels que les inondations, les vagues de chaleur ou les s\u00e9cheresses, ce qui exposera les \u00e9conomies et les march\u00e9s financiers \u00e0 des chocs de plus grande ampleur. Le pricing de cette augmentation des risques physiques constitue un d\u00e9fi de taille pour les investisseurs boursiers, qui doivent estimer la probabilit\u00e9 de divers sc\u00e9narios climatiques et leurs cons\u00e9quences pour les risques physiques au niveau de l'entreprise en s'appuyant sur des connaissances climatologiques et sur les mesures d'att\u00e9nuation et d'adaptation pr\u00e9vues. En outre, l'horizon temporel de cette \u00e9volution peut \u00eatre plus long que ce que les investisseurs institutionnels \u00e0 long terme ont l'habitude d'envisager.\n\nEn examinant r\u00e9trospectivement les valorisations des actions de 2019 dans les diff\u00e9rents pays, notre \u00e9quipe constate qu'elles sont \u00e9tablies sans tenir compte ni des sc\u00e9narios de r\u00e9chauffement climatique souvent \u00e9tudi\u00e9s, ni des changements connexes pr\u00e9vus en ce qui concerne l'occurrence des al\u00e9as ou l'incidence des risques physiques. Ce manque d'attention manifeste pourrait constituer une source majeure de risque pour le march\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avenir.\n\nQue peuvent faire les dirigeants ?\n\nL'actuelle pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19 nous rappelle combien la pr\u00e9paration et la r\u00e9silience aux crises sont essentielles pour g\u00e9rer les risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 des \u00e9pisodes tr\u00e8s incertains qui peuvent avoir des co\u00fbts extr\u00eamement \u00e9lev\u00e9s sur le plan \u00e9conomique et humain.\n\nComme mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, accro\u00eetre l'acc\u00e8s aux assurances et renforcer la solidit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re globale des \u00c9tats peut permettre d'att\u00e9nuer les r\u00e9percussions des catastrophes climatiques et donc de r\u00e9duire les risques pour la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re.\n\nLa mise au point de normes mondiales obligatoires en ce qui concerne la divulgation des risques physiques li\u00e9s au changement climatique constituerait \u00e9galement une mesure importante dans l'optique de pr\u00e9server la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re. Des donn\u00e9es d\u00e9taill\u00e9es et sp\u00e9cifiques aux entreprises sur l'exposition et la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 actuelles et futures aux chocs climatiques aideraient les cr\u00e9anciers, les assureurs et les investisseurs \u00e0 mieux appr\u00e9hender ces risques.\n\nLes tests de r\u00e9sistance au changement climatique peuvent permettre aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et aux instances de contr\u00f4le de mieux comprendre dans quelle mesure ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s sont expos\u00e9es \u00e0 des al\u00e9as climatiques et les risques physiques qui en d\u00e9coulent. Au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les services du FMI ont pris en consid\u00e9ration les risques physiques li\u00e9s aux catastrophes climatiques dans un programme d'\u00e9valuation du secteur financier sur cinq. Un exemple r\u00e9cent en est l'\u00e9valuation publi\u00e9e l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re pour les Bahamas.\n\nSans aucun doute, la solution la plus efficace consisterait \u00e0 prendre des mesures fortes au niveau mondial pour r\u00e9duire les \u00e9missions de gaz \u00e0 effet de serre, en s'attaquant \u00e0 la cause du r\u00e9chauffement climatique de mani\u00e8re durable et en offrant des avantages qui vont bien au-del\u00e0 du simple champ de la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re.\n\n*****\n\nFelix Suntheim est expert principal du secteur financier \u00e0 la division analyse de la stabilit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re mondiale au sein du d\u00e9partement des march\u00e9s mon\u00e9taires et de capitaux du FMI.

I report di Goldman Sachs", "dtype": "news", "pk": 216369864, "text": "Qual \u00e8 l'mpatto della pandemia da coronavirus sul debito pubblico degli Stati? Quali conseguenze sull'Europa che gi\u00e0 nel primo trimestre del 2020 ha mostrato una recessione pensante e destinata a diventare ancora pi\u00f9 dura? E ancora, che cosa accadr\u00e0 alle relazioni tra Stati Uniti d'America e Cina? Le risposte in tre report che Goldman Sachs ha appena pubblicato e che Affaritaliani.it pubblica in versione originale.\n\nTop of Mind: Daunting Debt Dynamics\n\nGovernment deficits, debt issuance and debt levels are set to surge as countries race to ease the economic impact of the coronacrisis. This raises many questions: who will finance this debt, will it force a market repricing and/or an eventual growth or inflation problem, and would greater use of negative rates help avoid any of these risks? At the same time, whether corporate bankruptcies could derail the economic recovery is a key concern. In short, how disruptive the recent, dramatic shift in debt dynamics might be is Top of Mind. We consult Harvard Professor Kenneth Rogoff, University of Pennsylvania's David Skeel, and GS's own Jan Hatzius, Praveen Korapaty and Sylvia Yeh on these questions. Our key takeaways: the benefit of running large deficits today far outweighs any eventual costs; DM bond yields are likely to rise modestly as a result; worries about distress in EMs are largely warranted, in munis are mostly not, and in the Euro area are somewhere in between; and a likely wave of corporate bankruptcies could prolong -- but likely won't derail -- the economic recovery.\n\nEuropean Daily: Short-time Work at Work\n\nActivity contracted sharply in the first quarter of 2020 across the Euro area, yet unemployment rates remained broadly unchanged. We argue that this uncharacteristically muted labour market reaction is largely attributable to unprecedented recourse to short-time work (STW) schemes, which are designed to shield employees from job losses.\n\nWith between 17% of employees in Spain and more than 45% in France placed in STW schemes so far, take-up rates have increased by an order of magnitude across the largest Euro area countries compared to the Global Financial Crisis. This strong take-up reflects both improved access and generosity, but also the nature of the shock with virus containment measures heavily affecting labour-intensive services.\n\nWhile short-time workers technically remain employed, their working hours fall involuntarily and we hence expect the \"U6\" underemployment rates to reach new historical highs in 2020. By contrast, the narrow \"U3\" unemployment rate is likely to remain artificially compressed as STW prevents large-scale employment losses. We therefore revise our 2020 unemployment rate forecasts to 4% in Germany, 9.5% in France, 12.6 % in Italy and 18.8% in Spain.\n\nGlobal Policy Comment: US-China Tensions and Bilateral Policy\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in confrontational political rhetoric in the US and China. In the US, in particular, politicians in both parties have stepped up criticism of China's handling of the coronavirus.\n\nIn a few recent cases, the Trump Administration has actually changed policy with respect to China, although so far most of these changes appear to have been in process for some time and might not reflect a sharp shift in the Administration's stance.", "uri": "6085310077", "url": "https://www.affaritaliani.it/economia/effetto-virus-su-debito-ue-usa-cina-i-report-di-goldman-sachs-675682.html"}], "6085307978": [262891941, {"published_on": "2020-05-29T17:25:00Z", "name": "Les d\u00e9put\u00e9s plaident pour une \u00e9conomie productive, non restrictive - La Nouvelle R\u00e9publique Alg\u00e9rie", "dtype": "news", "pk": 262891941, "text": "Le casse-t\u00eate des dispositions fiscales cit\u00e9es dans le PLFC 2020\n\nLutter contre la finance informelle qui impacte les opportunit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques depuis des ann\u00e9es et la d\u00e9finition des horizons \u00e9conomiques pour affronter la crise multiple \u00e0 laquelle fait face le pays, le projet de loi de finance compl\u00e9mentaire 2020 a adopter de nouvelles approches afin d'installer un certains \u00e9quilibre macro\u00e9conomique et microfinance, \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie.\n\nToutefois, les nouvelles dispositions introduites dans le PLFC 2020 tendent \u00e0 relancer de mani\u00e8re concr\u00e8te l'\u00e9conomie nationale \u00e0 travers la mise en place de nouvelles mesures attractives pour l'investissement en renouvelant le r\u00e9gime fiscal devant accompagner l'entreprise nationale en faveur de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du pays.

Although we are starting to see clients resume their previously paused campaigns, we continue to monitor closely to best protect our financial position and our investments.\"\n\nThe Company also held its annual general meeting on May 21, 2020 and is pleased to announce the appointment of James Beriker to the Board of Directors. Mr. Beriker is a Silicon Valley based technology entrepreneur and executive with start-up, growth stage and public company experience. His business experience includes entrepreneurial and executive positions in business-to-business advertising and marketing technology companies including as Founder/ CEO and Director of Search123, an early pay-per-click search engine (acquired by Conversant (formerly ValueClick)), CEO and Director of Efficient Frontier, a leading search engine marketing platform (acquired by Adobe), CEO and Director of Dapper, one of the first creative optimization platforms (acquired by Yahoo!), among others. Mr. Beriker is currently the CEO of LifeCycle Group, a firm made up of leaders in management, product management, engineering and finance that provides strategic and operational support for venture-backed companies. Mr. Beriker's appointment to the Company's board of directors is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSX-V\").\n\nAcceleration of Expiry Date of Warrants\n\nThe Company also announces today that it is accelerating the expiry date of 3,333,333 outstanding common share purchase warrants (the \"Warrants), which were issued pursuant to a non-brokered private placement in December 2019. Each Warrant is exercisable at a price of $1.00 per common share for a period of 24 months following issuance. The terms of the Warrants are such that the expiry date can be accelerated by the Company at any time if the closing price of the Company's common shares on the facilities of the TSX-V is greater than $1.25 for any 10 consecutive trading days following the date that is four months and one day after the closing of the private placement (the \"Acceleration Trigger\").\n\nThe Company confirms that as of the close of markets on May 25, 2020, the Acceleration Trigger had occurred. The Company intends delivered notice of the acceleration of the expiry date to each of the holders of Warrants, which will cause the Warrants to expire at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the 30th day following the delivery of the notice of acceleration (the \"Accelerated Expiry Date\"). Any Warrants remaining unexercised after the Accelerated Expiry Date will be cancelled. As of the close of markets on May 26, 2020, a total of 3,333,333 Warrants were outstanding. If all of the outstanding Warrants are exercised, gross proceeds to the Company will total $3,333,333.\n\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\n\nEQ Works measures the success of the Company's strategies and performance based on Adjusted EBITDA, which is outlined and reconciled with net income (loss) in the section entitled \"Reconciliation of Net Loss for the period to Adjusted EBITDA\" in the MD&A. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from operations before: (a) depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, (b) share-based payments, (c) finance income and costs, net, (d) depreciation of right-of-use assets, and (e) transaction costs of acquisition. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of the Company's operating performance because it provides information on the Company's ability to provide operating cash flows for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in its industry.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measure is used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of IFRS financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-IFRS financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-IFRS financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-IFRS adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-IFRS measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring.\n\nThe table below reconciles net loss from operations and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019(In thousands of Canadian dollars) 2020 2019 Net loss $(652) $(525)Add: Finance costs, net 126 55 Depreciation of property and equipment 16 13 Depreciation of right-to-use asset 18 42 Amortization of intangible assets 11 11 Share-based payments 9 29 Transaction costs of acquisition 23 - Adjusted EBITDA (449) (375)\n\nAbout EQ Works\n\nEQ Works (www.eqworks.com) enables businesses to understand, predict, and influence customer behaviour.

Economists said the figures were likely to be revised downwards as the data collection was affected by the lockdown in late March.\n\nThe quarterly figure of 3.1% growth was faster-than the 2.1% consensus in a Reuters poll of analysts, but was below downwardly revised 4.1% rate for the previous quarter.\n\nRupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings in Mumbai, said it would be a formidable challenge for policymakers to tackle both the health and economic challenges simultaneously in the coming year.\n\nShe said the lockdown, and uncertainty about its duration, \"will certainly push the country into a deep recession that was not witnessed in several decades\".\n\nHowever, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, in an interview to WION TV channel after the data release, that March quarter growth numbers indicated signs of some revival before the coronavirus, while promising to take more measures.\n\nThe government has maintained the lockdown ordered in late March though many restrictions were eased for manufacturing, transport and other services from May 18.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India cut policy rates by 40 basis points earlier this month, and has reduced its key repo rate by 115 basis points since February.\n\n'A SLOW GRIND'\n\nThe lockdown's full impact on manufacturing and services will become more apparent in the June quarter. Goldman Sachs has predicted a 45% contraction from a year ago, at the high end of estimates.\n\nIn the March quarter, private consumption grew 2.8%, down from 6.6% in the previous quarter while capital investment contracted 6.5%, compared to 5.1% fall in the previous three months, government data showed.\n\nEconomists expect the fiscal year that began in April will see the worst economic contraction in four decades, and say the economy could contract up to 5%.\n\nIndia has reported nearly 166,000 coronavirus cases, with 4,706 deaths.\n\nOn Friday, the government cut its growth estimate for the fiscal year that ended on March 31 to 4.2% - the lowest in 11 years - from a previously projected 5%.\n\nSeveral indicators - automobile sales, rail freight, petroleum product consumption, domestic air traffic and imports - indicate a recession in domestic consumption.\n\nIndia's infrastructure output, comprising nearly 40% of industrial output, contracted 38.1% in April from a year earlier, data released on Friday showed.\n\nEconomists warned India will suffer one of the slowest recoveries among major economies.\n\n\"The recovery process is likely to be a slow grind and we expect the catch-up process to pre-COVID-19 levels to take longer than earlier expected,\" said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at private lender HDFC Bank.\n\n(Reuters)", "uri": "6085307561", "url": "http://businessworld.in/article/Indian-Economy-Slows-In-March-Quarter-With-Worst-To-Come/29-05-2020-193609"}], "6085300750": [482980115, {"pk": 482980115, "name": "SThree: Holdings in Company", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "text": "SThree (STEM) SThree: Holdings in Company 29-May-2020 / 16:23 GMT/BST Dissemination of a Regulatory Announcement that contains inside information according to REGULATION (EU) No 596/2014 (MAR), transmitted by EQS Group.

Instead, in the months leading up to India's lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy opening up a fossil fuel expansion at home and abroad.\n\nOn January 26, four days before India reported its first coronavirus case, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was the guest of honor at India's Republic Day parade. India currently imports most of its crude oil from the Middle East and is looking to diversify its imports.\n\n\"We have to treble our energy consumption to catch up with the world... I will hold your hand and see that you don't face any difficulty,\" R.K. Singh, India's Power Minister, said to Bolsonaro and a gathering of Brazilian Investors.\n\nA month later, Namaste Trump drew 100,000 people in Modi's home state of Gujarat. And once again, fossil fuels were a big theme.\n\n\"Since I took office, our exports to India have nearly gone up by 60 percent and export of high quality American energy by-thank you very much -- 500 percent. That is great,\" President Donald Trump said.\n\nAmong the agreements Modi and Trump shook on was Exxon's deal with Indian Oil to set up pipelines to deliver more American fossil gas and crude oil by rail, road, and waterways to parts of India that are not connected by physical pipelines. Last February, Indian Oil sealed a long-term contract to buy more American crude. India is already the fifth top importer of U.S. fossil gas and fourth top importer of crude oil.\n\nNumerous global energy projects that counted on India's growth story hang in the balance: Rosneft's takeover of Essar Energy, Total's joint ventures with Adani's gas and solar businesses, BP and Reliance's retail and aviation fuels joint venture, and Saudi Aramco and ADNOC's investment in the world's largest oil refinery are among the handful of projects proposed or started in recent years. Now, all may be in jeopardy in one way or another. Standard & Poor projects that India and Indonesia will grow at 1.8 percent, \"previously unthinkable numbers for two high-speed economies.\"\n\nBecause it feeds nearly two-thirds of India's power needs, coal on the domestic front is still kosher. About 70 percent of India's coal is located in states where historically marginalized indigenous communities live, communities that are rarely informed or consulted when their lands and forests decimated for open-pit mines that require huge amounts of land and generate massive amounts of pollution. Coal mining, freight, ports, and power generation are among the industries that are exempt from India's lockdown restrictions. Coal India, the world's largest coal producer, might wear a mask on its Twitter logo. But it reported record production in the last three months and continues to race towards digging up 710 million tonnes of coal this year, a target set by the Modi government.\n\n\"They're probably able to mine faster than ever before, with none of us able to stop them,\" Manjeet Yadav, a resident of the coal mining town of Korba told Earther.\n\nOn March 5, Yadav was involved in a protest to stall the dispatch of coal from Gevra, one of Asia's biggest mines, along with thousands of locals like him who've lost their land to the void without getting the jobs and compensation they are due. Since 2014, the Modi government has weakened laws so people like Manjeet living near expanding coal mines wouldn't need to be consulted. Yet India's Environment Ministry is still virtually going to work to grant coal mines 30-year leases based on a Powerpoint presentation and a single Google Earth map file.\n\nOn April 30, two new mines operated by mining mogul Adani got off the ground. The mines, allocated to a state-owned company and contracted to Adani to run, had previously faced a groundswell of protests from indigenous communities who've conserved the dense forests where the mines are slighted to be dug up for generations. More than 100,000 trees are being axed for the mines, to the detriment of Munda and Gond Adivasis who rely on these forests for food, fuel and their livelihoods. Another coal mine proposal on the docket would go through the heart of an elephant preserve.\n\nCompanies like Coal India say that social distancing is being maintained in their offices and that they distributed 330,000 masks. But locals told Earther masks are only being distributed to the company's office workers in leafy colonies, not workers on the frontlines or the communities who live next to mines who live with pollution every day.\n\n\"How do you socially distance in an underground mine?\" one worker told Earther who has received no protective equipment.\n\nAll this is happening even as India's need for coal has dropped precipitously. Actual power demand in India has fallen by a whopping 30 percent, and electricity consumption dropped to levels last seen five years ago, as industries that were still running faced transport hurdles during India's lockdown and workers who'd migrated from the hinterland struggled to make their way back home. Power plants have more than enough coal on their hands and nowhere else to store it. Some coal ports are also filled to the brim. At the start of this month, roughly 800,000 tonnes of South African coal lie at India's key eastern port of Krishnapatnam. Where excess coal stock will be stored is anybody's guess. Employees warn that there's an actual danger of coal stocks catching fire, causing even more pollution in a respiratory pandemic.\n\nIndia's ash dams are running out of space to store coal waste. In the week after fossil fuel magnate Mukesh Ambani -- who flew in Beyonce to perform at his daughter's wedding -- lost his spot as Asia's richest man, six bodies were pulled out of coal ash where Ambani's Reliance's Ultra Mega Power Project's ash dam breached. Toxic ash slurry flooded fields up to nine kilometers downstream. This is the third ash breach in a year that coal town Singrauli has seen. No company officials have faced arrest to date.\n\n\"Who do you reach out to in times of accidents under lockdown? If goods have to be transported, then how many times a day? Health and safety, everything that is linked is shut,\" Kanchi Kohli, an environmentalist and researcher, told Earther. She said there's no clarity about how India's pollution control boards are enforcing industry's compliance to India's environmental laws or how they're monitoring emissions and safety.\n\nBoards are often thinly staffed, checks are minimal and industry often operates without permits or scrutiny, while authorities look the other way. Earlier in May, a gas leak from a South-Korean petrochemical plant killed 12 people in the Eastern port city of Visakhapatnam: the plant was found to be operating without environmental clearances for nearly two decades.\n\nSectors like thermal power that are already in debt may take years to recover citing losses, as power demand drops. India's banks battling bad loans from the coal sector for years are now faced with the prospect of even more stressed assets. Renewables -- the smallest portion of India's energy mix -- are unlikely to have the liquidity to weather cancelled power purchase agreements. The Modi government may have loosened the leash for new renewable energy plants to commence operations and asked that states honor their deals. But experts estimate 3 gigawatts of solar and wind projects could be held up because of the covid-19 lockdown.\n\nMeanwhile, large hydropower projects that will count towards India's non-fossil fuel capacity are slated to be greenlit. The dams are planned on a tributary of the Brahmaputra, a transboundary river that Bangladesh, Bhutan, and China depend on. The area is also a biodiversity hotspot on the Indo-China border that's home to the Idu Mishmi tribe and 75 globally threatened species, including endangered tigers. The Idu Mishmi consider the 52 tigers of the Dibang Valley their blood brothers, and their story is one of community conservation. The government's moves to expand hydro in the sensitive Himalayan region are being met with widespread opposition -- albeit online -- from the tribe who will be displaced en masse as well as conservation scientists who worry about biodiversity loss, earthquakes, and glacial lakes bursting.\n\nIndia's CO2 emissions might have fallen for the first time in four decades, according to expert analysis over at Carbon Brief. But their scenarios for what happens after the lockdown seem extremely optimistic, given the Indian government's policy response since.\n\nWhere will all this energy go?\n\nLast September, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took some heat for blaming Uber-hailing millennials for falling automotive sales. But GDP numbers had already been falling since 2017: India's economic and energy demand slowdown was already well under way before the virus got here.\n\n\"Lackluster power demand might not last forever,\" energy reporter Shreya Jai told Earther. \"The comeback, at best, could look like the days after demonetisation\" - referring to the time Modi junked India's currency overnight.\n\nCovid-19 could slow this growth story down further, but it could also be an opportunity for the country to examine its energy choices, fix its air pollution crisis, and resolve environmental conflicts, given that the region is amongst the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It will also test the country's political relationships with the rest of the world.\n\nWhat energy trajectory will India choose, now that it can see through the haze?", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:00:00Z", "uri": "6085306764", "url": "https://earther.gizmodo.com/clear-skies-are-a-cover-up-for-india-s-fossil-fuel-expa-1843754993"}], "6085308198": [832758975, {"pk": 832758975, "name": "Covid-19 pandemic could cost county council \u00a3120 million", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic could cost Derbyshire County Council more than \u00a3120 million - a fifth of its entire budget.\n\nA month ago the authority said extra costs caused by the virus outbreak stood at \u00a332 million and were set to rise to \u00a350 million as a \"best estimate\".\n\nHowever, this has now increased by more than double, with the authority potentially facing \"drastic measures\" to balance its books.\n\nNow, ahead of a meeting of the council's Conservative ruling cabinet next week, the authority says the pandemic could cost it \u00a3120 million.\n\nIt says the impact up to June - combining extra costs and a loss in income - is \u00a330 million.\n\nIn a \"worst case scenario\" the council could see a further \u00a360 million hit caused by paying local care providers extra fees.\n\nThe council has already spent \u00a37.5 million on personal protective equipment (PPE), largely for care staff, but the authority says this could nearly triple to \u00a320 million.\n\nCouncil tax shortfalls - caused by Derbyshire's districts and borough's relaxing payments during the crisis - could cost it \u00a310 million.\n\nAll of these estimated figures depend on monthly cost and income shortfalls maintaining at their current rate and do not account for a potential second spike of the virus outbreak.\n\nThe council is already saying that the cost of support for vulnerable children - a core statutory and legal function of the authority - is to spike following the relaxation of lockdown.\n\nIt is hoping the extra costs will be covered by the Government.\n\nPeter Handford, the council's finance chief, said: \"As the year progresses the likely position on these costs will become clearer and the Government will be expected to contribute significant further sums to avoid councils taking drastic measures to ensure they remain financially sustainable.\"\n\nOn costs for supporting children in care, he says: \"Whilst the figures quoted assume that costs will be triggered in the three-month period to the end of June, higher levels of expenditure will be incurred well beyond this time frame.\n\n\"Evidence from other countries that have relaxed lockdown is that there is a spike in the numbers of children needing the support of social care services, therefore these costs will not be unravelled on July 1 even if normality is resumed at that date.\"\n\nIf the council has to commission places for children with private providers these costs will be \"significantly higher\".\n\nThe authority has now received \u00a337 million in grants from central government to cover the extra costs of the pandemic - with officials saying they will not compensate local authorities for all costs, particularly those above and beyond statutory duties.\n\nMr Handford now says the authority only has \u00a35 million in grant funding left.\n\nThe authority has already said it faced an \"extreme\" and \"almost certain\" risk that it would not be able to meet its required budget cut targets, with front-line services on the line.\n\nPapers released last week said: \"In the event that the authority does not develop sufficient and timely proposals to deal with the ongoing or further reductions in funding/resources, there is a risk that the need to close the funding gap may result in identifying measures for unplanned reductions in service spend leading to deterioration or interruption of front line service delivery.\"\n\nTo balance its books, the council was already trying to make cuts of \u00a365 million or more by the end of the 2024 financial year.\n\nIt has already had to delay many of the proposed cuts until after next year's council election.\n\nThe authority had planned to make \u00a333.4 million in cuts this year but in January reduced that to \u00a319 million and delayed further cutbacks to 2022 onwards.\n\nYesterday (Thursday May 28), a fire destroyed Harrington Junior School in Long Eaton, which is maintained by the county council, and it must be replaced.\n\nThis will prove to be another substantial pressure on the council's struggling finances.\n\nThe most recent new school plans from the county council - with 210 places (fewer than Harrington) in Littleover - are to cost \u00a36.2 million.\n\nIn January, the county council said it still had a \u00a3150 million school repairs backlog but that it was receiving just \u00a37.7 million from central government to support this (five per cent of the total).\n\nThe council had said it was at risk of not being able to uphold its legal duty to maintain the upkeep of hundreds of schools.\n\nAnother currently unknown cost to the council is the price of school transport under Covid-19 social distancing restrictions.\n\nSchool buses will only be able to cater for a quarter of the usual number of students to maintain this distancing - meaning many more vehicles are required.\n\nThis is cited by the council as an additional cost which forms part of the pandemic recovery strategy which is \"yet to be costed\".\n\nSchools are due to reopen on June 1 in three days.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:17:00Z", "uri": "6085308198", "url": "https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/covid-19-pandemic-could-cost-4174717"}], "6085306416": [993474018, {"pk": 993474018, "name": "Capital Accountant ", "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "text": "Interim Capital Accountant Job -

Professional fees in Canada increased by $30,609 mostly due to an increase in audit fees.\n\nMarketing and promotion of $32,459 in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $70,282) declined due to less trade shows and travel mostly related to the Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nFiling and transfer agent fees of $27,850 in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $11,050) increased due to the increase in filing fees related to the increase in outstanding shares and market capitalization.\n\nOther general and administrative expenses of $70,539 in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $73,883) include $44,662 (Q1 2019: $61,873) related to operations in Brazil, and $25,877 (Q1 2019: $12,010) related to operations in Canada.\n\nStock-based compensation of $nil in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019: $48,111). There were no stock options granted in Q1 2020. The Q1 2019 stock compensation relates to unvested options granted in 2018.\n\nForeign exchange gain of $166,311 (Q1 2019: $15,864) was due mostly to the DNPM liability that is recorded in Brazilian reals. The decline in the value of the Brazilian reals relative to the Canadian dollar in Q1 2020 accounted for most of this foreign exchange gain.\n\nInterest and finance charges of $21,550 (Q1 2019: $1,724) relate mostly to the accrual of interest on the DNPM liability.\n\nAbout Amarillo\n\nAmarillo Gold Corporation (www.amarillogold.com) is advancing two gold projects in Brazil. Both are in mining-friendly states and have excellent nearby infrastructure.\n\nThe development stage Posse Gold Project on its Mara Rosa Property in Goi\u00e1s State has received the main permit that provides social and environmental permission for mining.

Scholars have recognized that the modern-day control of social, economic, political and cultural aspects of former colonies by modern powers is still happening. They call it \"neocolonialism.\"\n\nAs public health experts who have worked extensively on global health issues, we've been struck by how this neocolonialist attitude has played out in this unprecedented pandemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization has sent a message to every country in the world during this pandemic: \"Test, test, test.\"\n\nBut not every country felt the message was meant for them. In mid-March the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. Yet at a press conference, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, stated that the WHO guidelines did not apply to the UK's \"extremely well-developed public health system.'\" She explained that WHO's recommended approach for all countries were actually meant more for lower income countries.\n\nNeedless to say, that philosophy did not stick.\n\nThe government now recommends widespread testing and in fact set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the U.K. by the end of April.\n\nThe U.K. and other onetime colonial powers did not turn to their former colonies or to the East for advice - although they should have.\n\nAfrican and Asian countries have had far more experience dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS than the United States and the countries of Europe. But neocolonialism relies on the continued belief that former colonial rulers are superior in terms of expertise and societal values. Not only are such attitudes racist and xenophobic, they're illogical.\n\nAnd it represents a kind of overconfidence that has literally been deadly. There was public knowledge of a viral respiratory epidemic threat from China in January, yet serious nationwide public health responses in the U.S. and U.K. did not start until March 2020.\n\nEven once it became clear that wealthy countries were at risk, there was a widespread reluctance to learn from China and from other Asian countries.\n\nThe American reaction focused instead on blaming China - consider President Trump's use of the term \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nChina was further criticized for using draconian measures when millions of people in Wuhan were put under lockdown - even though the countries of the West that denigrated such tactics might today be better off if they had acted similarly.\n\nIndeed, recent data suggests that the majority of cases in the United States came from New York City. Restricting travel out of the city, as was done in Wuhan, might have meant far fewer cases in the U.S.\n\nAnd while Trump put an early ban on much travel from China, effective Feb. 1, he delayed any travel bans from European countries even as the virus toll mounted until mid-March. Today, we know that most of the cases in the eastern U.S. were of European origin.\n\nThen there is the matter of face masks.\n\nAt first the U.S. made it seem as if wearing masks was based on superstition and had no benefit. So the message was that the mask-wearing citizens of China and other Asian countries were being foolish. As late as Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen.\n\nBut the data is showing that universal masking could dramatically curb transmission. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did in fact change its earlier view and endorse the public use of cloth masks. To us, the hesitancy to adopt universal masking in public has been another example of Western arrogance.\n\nWhat's more, even former colonies are influenced by neocolonialism in the way they make decisions.\n\nSome of the solutions that work in the West are being imported by lower-income countries without consideration to whether they can work and what unforeseen consequences there might be.\n\nIt's one thing for a country like Italy, Spain or the U.K. to call for a full-country lockdown. Many workers can switch to at-home work and not lose income. But in countries with widespread poverty, a lockdown immediately means the end of income for street vendors, construction workers and many others who earn their living day-by-day - and the very real threat of hunger as their income evaporates.\n\nAnother argument for lockdowns is that if fewer people become ill, health-care systems will not be overwhelmed and will have time to acquire the equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nBut in low-income settings, that kind of gearing up is much harder to accomplish. They already have far fewer ventilators, ICU-level beds and critical-care trained doctors.\n\nAnd the government doesn't necessarily have the ability to finance that kind of scaling up. One reason, in our opinion, is the nature of so-called \"structural adjustment grants\" offered to low-income countries by the World Bank since the second half of the 20th century. The idea was that the money would be used to build up the private sector rather than to strengthen essential social systems like health care. And these grants have a legacy of ongoing debt that countries are still paying back to this day.\n\nYet in spite of it all, we see some signs of hope - ways that the world is rejecting neocolonialism.\n\nA new attitude is emerging: The idea that countries that have responded to outbreaks for so long have something to teach the West. These countries that battled Ebola already have systems in place to do a job that everyone says is critical for controlling the novel coronavirus: contact tracing. They know how to gather information about all the contacts of a newly diagnosed person and then set up systems to isolate those contacts until the risk of infection has passed. We can and must adopt their expertise here as well - and we are. The state of Massachusetts is collaborating with global health group Partners In Health to use the contact tracing and isolation strategies that were initially honed in the Ebola response in West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also new partnerships to train community health workers, learning from the work of Last Mile Health, which leads such programs in Liberia.\n\nThat's progress - but not enough progress.\n\nThe lessons and expertise of the East and of African countries, coupled with the resources and power of the West, could have allowed us all to fare better. And as COVID-19 spreads globally, we will be called upon to collaborate.\n\nWe need to make sure we answer that call.\n\nAbraar Karan is an internal medicine physician and clinical fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Derri\u00e8re la syntaxe boiteuse se cache une id\u00e9ologisation du principe de pr\u00e9caution qui, \u00e9tendu au langage, contient des potentialit\u00e9s dystopiques et \"dysph\u00e9mistiques\" inqui\u00e9tantes.\n\n\" LIRE AUSSI - Chantal Delsol: \"Le l\u00e9gislateur a une conception tr\u00e8s subjective de la haine sur Internet\"\n\nParadoxalement, le gouvernement chinois a compris \u00e0 rebours du l\u00e9gislateur fran\u00e7ais que l'incitation \u00e9conomique fonctionnait mieux que la contrainte. \"Green Dam Youth Escort\" a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9 au profit d'un autre projet, le \"Syst\u00e8me de Cr\u00e9dit Social (SCS)\", lanc\u00e9 en 2014, qui s'appuie sur la ma\u00eetrise des technologies du Big Data et de la reconnaissance faciale afin d'\u00e9valuer le \"degr\u00e9 de civisme\" des citoyens chinois. Il ne s'agit pas d'un syst\u00e8me centralis\u00e9 et gouvernemental, mais d'une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'applications propos\u00e9es aux utilisateurs d'ordinateurs et de smartphone par huit firmes priv\u00e9es, dont les g\u00e9ants Tencent et Alibaba.

Loin d'\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme les avatars num\u00e9riques de 1984, ces outils d'\u00e9valuation \"civique\" sont plut\u00f4t per\u00e7us, en particulier par les classes urbaines et ais\u00e9es, comme des services offrant, en \u00e9change d'une forme de contr\u00f4le somme toute mod\u00e9r\u00e9e, certains avantages allant des facilit\u00e9s de cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s aux services sociaux ou culturels, en passant par toute une gamme de r\u00e9ductions sur des produits de consommation et autres services.\n\nLa situation in\u00e9dite cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la pand\u00e9mie de Covid-19 pourrait amener les pays occidentaux \u00e0 adapter plus encore les mani\u00e8res de faire chinoises. Le principe de pr\u00e9caution sanitaire justifie la mise en place d'un tra\u00e7age num\u00e9rique ambitieux avec l'application \"StopCovid\", d\u00e9fendue par le gouvernement \u00e0 l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale le 27 mai 2020. Dans un rapport parlementaire du 6 avril, le d\u00e9put\u00e9 LREM Mounir Mahjoubi appelait \u00e0 \"se saisir de tous les moyens \u00e0 disposition, sans toutefois compromettre nos valeurs et nos libert\u00e9s\" en s'inspirant des exp\u00e9rimentations faites \u00e0 Honk-Kong ou Ta\u00efwan permettant d'op\u00e9rer, via des applications install\u00e9es sur smartphones, une collecte de donn\u00e9es \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle, pour contr\u00f4ler les d\u00e9placements de populations. \"Il en va de la confiance en nos institutions\".\n\nLe probl\u00e8me est justement que cette confiance est d\u00e9j\u00e0 largement entam\u00e9e, comme l'a encore d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la crise des Gilets Jaunes, et que le risque est grand de voir s'installer, au nom du principe de pr\u00e9caution, une variante lib\u00e9rale de ce qui se pratique d\u00e9j\u00e0 en Chine ou de multiples applications et une d\u00e9clinaison d'algorithmes permettent d\u00e9j\u00e0 de contr\u00f4ler l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 des citoyens, de d\u00e9terminer l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 certains p\u00e9rim\u00e8tres en fonction d'un relev\u00e9 de temp\u00e9rature ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par une borne ou un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou de d\u00e9cider de la mise en quarantaine de tel ou tel individu.\n\nAu premier rang des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui d\u00e9veloppent ces applications, on trouve \u00e0 nouveau le g\u00e9ant Alibaba et l'on constate \u00e0 nouveau que la Chine plut\u00f4t que de recourir \u00e0 des moyens coercitifs et des agences publiques, s'appuie de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur ses \"tech companies\", les BATX, pour proposer une offre de management sanitaire. Celle-ci, par l'entremise de la captation des donn\u00e9es dans le cyberespace, la vid\u00e9osurveillance, les technologies de reconnaissance faciale et la mise en oeuvre d'incitations commerciales constitue un syst\u00e8me de contr\u00f4le social bien plus efficace et d'autant plus facilement accept\u00e9 par les populations qu'il est \u00e9conomiquement viable et qu'il peut se parer de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 sanitaire.\n\nEn d\u00e9pit des tensions qui peuvent exister entre la Chine et les pays occidentaux, le mod\u00e8le chinois de contr\u00f4le sanitaire et social est un mod\u00e8le qui s'exporte, non seulement en Asie, o\u00f9 les entreprises chinoises ont propos\u00e9 et diffus\u00e9 leurs outils, mais aussi en Europe ou aux Etats-Unis, o\u00f9 l'on s'inspire du mod\u00e8le asiatique pour \"StopCovid\" et o\u00f9 Apple et Google ont propos\u00e9 \u00e9galement, le 10 avril 2020, une application commune de tra\u00e7age des malades qui puisse \u00eatre propos\u00e9e aux gouvernements am\u00e9ricains ou europ\u00e9ens. Le gouvernement britannique semble d'ailleurs la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la solution de tra\u00e7age fran\u00e7aise.\n\nLa surveillance et le management social sont cependant des march\u00e9s lucratifs qui n'ont pas attendu le Covid pour se d\u00e9velopper, de m\u00eame que les entreprises chinoises n'ont pas attendu la pand\u00e9mie pour exporter le savoir-faire acquis en la mati\u00e8re. Dans le domaine de la vid\u00e9osurveillance, la Chine a fait du Xinjiang, province d\u00e9sertique travaill\u00e9e par le s\u00e9paratisme ou\u00efgour faisant trois fois la taille de la France, un v\u00e9ritable laboratoire de la vid\u00e9osurveillance et P\u00e9kin exporte depuis longtemps son savoir-faire en la mati\u00e8re puisque les cam\u00e9ras de surveillance de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 chinoise HikVision \u00e9quipent Londres depuis une vingtaine d'ann\u00e9es. Les ambitions chinoises vont m\u00eame bien plus loin avec la Digital Silk Road, \"route de la soie num\u00e9rique\" qui double la \"nouvelle route de la soie\" que la Chine finance \u00e0 coups de milliards de yens depuis les ann\u00e9es 2010.\n\nAvec ce projet pharaonique, l'ambition de P\u00e9kin n'est rien moins que de faire de ses techs companies des leaders de l'univers num\u00e9rique en exportant massivement son savoir-faire en mati\u00e8re de big data, de contr\u00f4le des donn\u00e9es et, de ce fait, des populations. La pand\u00e9mie de Covid-19 aura cr\u00e9\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9normes besoins et la pr\u00e9sence assidue et active de la repr\u00e9sentation chinoise, en plus de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 ou de l'Organisation Mondiale du Commerce, \u00e0 l'Union des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications Internationales (UTI) au sein de l'ONU montre la volont\u00e9 de P\u00e9kin d'\u00eatre leader dans l'\u00e9laboration des normes internationales en mati\u00e8re de communication et de NTIC.\n\n\u00c0 l'occasion de la journ\u00e9e internationale des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications du 17 mai, Houlin Zhao, Secr\u00e9taire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'UTI a soulign\u00e9 les ambitions du programme \"Connect 2030\" de d\u00e9veloppement mondial de \"nouvelles technologies telles que la 5G, les transports intelligents, l'Internet des objets, l'intelligence artificielle et la cha\u00eene de blocs\", programme de d\u00e9veloppement dont la Chine est l'un des principaux artisans. Et les menaces am\u00e9ricaines \u00e0 l'encontre des firmes chinoises n'entament pas la d\u00e9termination de P\u00e9kin. Il faut rappeler ici que Huawei est sans conteste le leader dans les infrastructures t\u00e9l\u00e9coms de cinqui\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration (5G), et d'autre part que les Am\u00e9ricains sont quasi absents de ce secteur. En f\u00e9vrier dernier, des voix au sein de l'administration Trump sugg\u00e9raient des prises de participation dans Nokia ou Ericsson dans le but de rattraper le retard dans la 5G et de profiter du peu d'entrain de l'UE \u00e0 soutenir ses propres acteurs technologiques.\n\nCar si le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain se ferme aux entreprises chinoises, en Europe en revanche, les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones portables de Xiaomi et Huawei concurrencent de plus en plus ceux de Samsung et Apple.

This remedy already exists, we will use it. It's already been discussed with the WHO,\" said Rajoelina, during a visit on Tuesday to Toamasina, the capital of the Atsinanana region on the east coast.\n\n\"Madagascar's received all the necessary authorisations in the eyes of the scientific committee to be able to carry out clinical trials here too,\" Rajoelina added, according to Sarah T\u00e9taud, a correspondent in Antananarivo.\n\nRajoelina has been promoting the use of artemisia to treat the coronavirus, promising to deliver Covid-Organics, a Malagasy concoction based on the medicinal plant, to several African countries. He also recently agreed to send artemisia-based products to the Caribbean.\n\nArtemisia is not without merit -- a South African researcher recently launched a crowdfunding initiative to help finance clinical trials of both Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra, two species of the plant, to help determine their effectiveness against Covid-19.\n\nA derivative of one of the plant's compounds is also used as part of a combined drug malaria treatment, but there are concerns that using artemisia on its own could encourage antimalarial drug resistance.\n\nNevertheless, the World Health Organisation at the start of May told RFI that they were yet to receive any data from Madagascar about the Covid-Organics product and its effectiveness against Covid-19.\n\nContradictions\n\nMadagascar's presidency somewhat backtracked over claims about starting an artemisia clinical trial, describing a misunderstanding by the media about what Rajoelina was saying.\n\n\"In fact, there's confusion, maybe the media didn't understand what the president intended to announce,\" Michelle Sahondrarimalala, director of legal studies at the presidency, told RFI's Service Afrique.\n\nSahondrarimalala described different guidelines for the treatment of Covid-19 and a third protocol recently launched.\n\nThe first protocol uses chloroquine and azythromycine as a combined treatment as inspired by controversial French doctor Didier Raoult, Sahondrarimalala told correspondent T\u00e9taud. This treatment does not form part of a clinical trial in Madagascar since both these drugs have already been used for treatment of other diseases, according to the Malagasy official.\n\n\"The second protocol concerns Covid-Organics, the improved traditional remedy, developed on the basis of WHO guidelines for clinical studies of traditional medicine in Africa,\" Sahondrarimalala added, referring to the artemisia herbal tea Rajoelina has been promoting.\n\nAn injectable form of an artemisia-based treatment had yet to be developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research or national pharmaceutical research centre, said Sahondrarimalala. \"Because you mustn't forget that as soon as Covid-Organics is transformed into an injectable form, it is no longer considered an improved traditional remedy.\"\n\nNo injections of artemisia\n\nThe third protocol, which is the one involved in clinical trials, is a combined treatment for Covid-19 patients, said Sahondrarimalala. It is based on two drugs, in injectable form, already on the market and used therapeutically, she added. However, this has nothing to do with the Covid-Organics product.\n\nSahondrarimalala would not reveal the name of the two drugs being used in this clinical trial, since this would be up to the research team, the scienitific committee, \"but it's not artemisia, there's no artemisia,\" she said.\n\nThese comments from an official within Madagascar's presidency appear to directly contradict Rajoelina's announcement about clinical trials on an injectable artemisia-based product.

This will now likely need to be even greater,\" it said.\n\nThe US research organisation said Bangladesh faces significant, long-term overcapacity, and the prospect of increasing subsidies, power tariffs and capacity payments for idle plants if coal and LNG plants are built as planned.\n\n\"With power demand growth set to be dragged down by the coronavirus pandemic, there is now an opportunity to reset the nation's power development policy and pivot towards renewable energy (without capacity payments) along with grid investment to improve system strength and allow the addition of more renewables to the grid,\" it added.\n\nRenewables to help realise 'Vision 2041'\n\nIn addition to grid upgrades and modernisation to reduce system losses, domestic renewable energy can also reduce overall system costs while enhancing energy security and resilience, the IEEFA observed.\n\nTo mobilise the required funding for promotion of renewable energy, it said a flexible approach to unnecessary China-funded coal power proposals may be possible if governments engage more proactively with China on a preference for renewables.\n\n\"Proposals promoting fossil-fuels could be supplanted by more appropriate grid and renewables projects rather than simply being cancelled,\" it said.\n\nSetting a precedent for renegotiation, the IEEFA said the power minister of Bangladesh advised power division officials to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance and donor agencies for support because of the huge financial losses in the power sector.\n\nIEEFA said that globally and regionally in South Asia, renewable energy is already less than two-thirds the cost of imported fossil fuels. Bangladesh is well-positioned to take advantage of deflationary renewable energy to reduce overall system cost and provide affordable energy to households and industry.\n\n\"Less reliance on imported fuel avoids the ups and downs of volatile commodity markets can give valuable price stability to enable the realisation of 'Vision 2041' of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which aims to accelerate growth in high-value agriculture, trade and industry, education and healthcare, and transport and communication,\" the US research body said.\n\nDomestic renewable energy can provide Bangladesh with more resilience to external shocks, improve its competitiveness and thus improve growth potential, it mentioned in the report.\n\nGiven likely falls in solar module prices of 5-10 per cent over the coming decade, not only will renewable energy soon be the cheapest form of new power generation in Bangladesh, it will also be quick to build while not adding to air pollution or carbon emissions.\n\nAffordable energy over the medium and long term remains essential for Bangladesh to sustain rapid economic growth. Bangladesh should reprioritise its power system development and redirect resources at technologies that can deliver the price stability and competitiveness required to realise the goals of 'Vision 2041', IEEFA said.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:21:00Z", "uri": "6085303748", "url": "https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/national/renewable-energy-could-be-bangladeshs-best-option-post-covid-19-1590772460"}], "6085302934": [594691798, {"pk": 594691798, "name": "Financing: What It Means and Why It Matters", "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "text": "The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) gives a clear picture of a firm's total cost of financing.\n\nThere are two main types of financing available for companies: debt financing and equity financing.

RGENIX's abstract, \"Phase 1 trial of RGX-202, a first-in-class oral inhibitor of the SLC6a8/CKB pathway, in patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) solid tumors\", is being presented by Dr. Johanna Bendell, Director of the Drug Development Unit at Sarah Cannon Research Center in Nashville, and clinical investigator and lead author on the study, as part of the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program during an oral abstract session available on demand starting on May 29.\n\nRGX-202 is an oral small molecule inhibitor of the creatine transporter SLC6a8 that depletes intracellular phospho-creatine and ATP levels, leading to the death of cancer cells. The SLC6a8/CKB pathway was discovered using RGENIX's proprietary miRNA-based target-discovery platform applied to KRAS mutant CRC. Due to increased metabolic demand, KRAS mutant tumors are highly susceptible to blockade of SLC6a8. In CKB-expressing (CKB+) pre-clinical models, RGX-202 treatment triggers tumor regressions across KRAS mutant subtypes. The ongoing Phase 1 trial of the compound is an escalation/expansion study of RGX-202 with or without FOLFIRI in patients with advanced GI tumors, and the trial will identify the maximum tolerated dose, or the dose at which multiple dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not observed, and to determine the antitumor activity of the RGX-202.\n\nAs of April 29, 2020, 17 patients with advanced relapsed/refractory gastrointestinal cancers have been treated in 4 single agent dose escalation cohorts, with doses ranging from 600mg twice a day (BID) up to 3600mg BID. RGX-202 was well tolerated at all doses, with the majority (69%) of RGX-202-related adverse events (AEs) being grade 1 in severity with the most common AEs being nausea and vomiting. No DLTs were observed at any dose; notably, in the two highest cohorts, drug exposures predicted to be sufficient to inhibit human tumor growth from preclinical models were achieved along with concomitant pharmacodynamic effects.\n\n10 patients were evaluable for response across all dose cohorts. Among the 5 evaluable patients with KRAS mutant CRC, 1 achieved a PR and 2 achieved stable disease, for an ORR of 20% and a disease control rate of 60%. Durable clinical benefit was observed in the highest dose cohort; a patient with KRAS G12V mutant CRC had a confirmed partial response of 40 weeks duration, and a patient with KRAS G13D mutant CRC experienced stable disease for 16 weeks. The ORR in all evaluable CRC patients - regardless of KRAS status - was 10% with a disease control rate (DCR) of 40%. A dose-escalation study assessing RGX-202 plus the chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI is ongoing, with a planned expansion cohort in CKB+ CRC.\n\nMasoud Tavazoie, MD, PhD, and Chief Executive Officer of RGENIX, said, \"Though RGX-202 is still in an early stage of development, the results obtained to date are exciting. The single agent safety and activity profile provide a foundation for further development of RGX-202, including in combination regimens. Importantly, the results further validate our target discovery approach, which has now yielded two first-in-class clinical compounds, RGX-104 and RGX-202, both with single agent activity against novel targets discovered using our RNA-based platform technology. We look forward to sharing additional data from our programs as they progress through clinical development.\"\n\nAbout RGENIX\n\nRGENIX, Inc., is a privately-held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel cancer drugs that target key pathways in cancer progression. The company is pursuing several first-in-class drug candidates to treat cancers of high unmet need.

The target of RGX-202, the SLC6a8/CKB pathway, is over-expressed in several prevalent cancer types, including KRAS mutant colorectal cancer. RGX-202 has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies, both as a single agent as well as in combination with standard-of-care therapies.

Submissions for the series can be sent to HowWeWorkNow@Billboard.com. Read the full series here.\n\nThis installment is with Ed Keane, president of artist management and booking firm Ed Keane Associates.\n\nEd Keane: Because COVID-19 has been particularly devastating for the touring side of the industry, I've been looking at this as a two-phase situation. Phase one was crisis management: rebooking engagements, rebooking tours and reworking deals among the greater community. I'm lucky, because after 30 years of working in music -- between the club circuit, festivals, performing arts centers and concert stages -- I have a history of relationships within that community, which makes a difference when you're trying to work together. So in that sense, it's been a nice community to work within because everybody's in the same boat.\n\nThe toughest and most challenging element of phase one was the financial devastation. When you're a touring artist, you're booking flights and other future expenses that are compensated once the engagement is played. So cash flow became very critical. What do you do for your core people? Whether they're employees or 1099's, they're also like family. So you're trying to attend to each of these very personal relationships to make sure that mortgages can be paid, food can be bought and families can go on. Early on, we really focused on SBA loans: who's going to handle what, assigning different tasks and making sure that our business managers, accountants and everybody else was in the loop as quickly as we could organize it.\n\nNow that phase one is more manageable, phase two has been about, what can we do during this time that we aren't already doing or don't normally have the time to do? I'm referring to everything from creating social media and other content to talking more with my artists [which include Manhattan Transfer, Take 6 and Nnenna Freelon] from the standpoint of what we're doing, where we're going and how to take advantage of this time from a financial standpoint. We're creating more content not just for the sake of filling their time but for the sake of doing things that have been on the back burner.\n\nFor instance, Manhattan Transfer is coming up on their 50th anniversary in 2022. There are many plans on tap, including anniversary shows and special performance collaborations such as The Summit: Manhattan Transfer Meets Takes 6. We're also working on a documentary and developing a podcast. We're taking a similar approach with Take 6. I also work with the New Directions Veterans Choir, whose parent organization helps homeless veterans. One of the choir's members is Michelle Mayne-Graves, a nurse who has been taking care of COVID-19 patients while launching her own [singing] career.\n\nIt's very interesting to look at the positive aspects of taking a moment to pause in light of a very serious financial crisis with a yet-uncertain future. Because even though we can turn around and say, \"All right, let's get back to business,\" there's still the question of, how will we do that? When will people feel comfortable going to a concert, a sports stadium or out to hear a speaker?\n\nTouring is a very personal decision. It's how artists make their living. It's how I make my living, by and large. But I would never want artists to put themselves at risk. And I support the fans in their choices as much as I do the artists' and presenters' decisions. I would say let's roll it out according to what we're seeing for current cases across the country and the world. It's about working together.\n\nIn the meantime, I think many of us are sitting here figuring out what else we can do that's constructive and positive. What attention and support can we give to people who are on the front lines? I have a degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from Harvard and worked at Massachusetts General Hospital while I was in college. I also did some research in immunology, which was the path I was headed down. Then I told my family I wanted to do something secure, like show business, which they thought was crazy. [Laughs]\n\nHowever, I've been blessed. This is the 24th year of me having my own company. I have four people working for me and all are still on board. I wouldn't trade it, because even in moments like this, it's nice to feel the collaboration and sense of family among the artists and office folks that I work with. I refuse to give up the ship.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:01:00Z", "uri": "6085346107", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9393101/how-we-work-now-ed-keane-associates-president"}], "p-6085343336": [350850296, {"pk": 350850296, "name": "ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) Significantly Improved Tumor Response Rate and Overall Survival in HER2-positive Metastatic Gastric Cancer in Phase II DESTINY-Gastric01 Trial", "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "text": "Breakthrough Therapy Designation recently granted in the US for ENHERTU in this setting\n\nWILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Detailed results from the positive registrational, randomized controlled Phase II DESTINY-Gastric01 trial showed AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited's (Daiichi Sankyo) ENHERTU\u00ae (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, versus chemotherapy.\n\nThe trial evaluated patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed following two or more treatment regimens including trastuzumab and chemotherapy.\n\nGastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality with a five-year survival rate of 5% for metastatic disease. Approximately one in five gastric cancers are considered HER2 positive.\n\nThe confirmed ORR, assessed by independent central review, was 42.9% with ENHERTU monotherapy (6.4mg/kg) compared to 12.5% with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan). Ten complete responses (CRs) and 41 partial responses (PRs) were seen in patients treated with ENHERTU versus no CRs and seven PRs seen in patients treated with chemotherapy.\n\nPatients treated with ENHERTU had a 41% reduction in the risk of death versus patients treated with chemotherapy (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.88; p=0.0097) at a pre-specified interim analysis. The median OS was 12.5 months versus 8.4 months with chemotherapy. The estimated OS rate at one year in the ENHERTU arm was 52.1% and 28.9% with the chemotherapy arm.\n\nKohei Shitara, Chief of Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan and principal investigator in the Phase II DESTINY-Gastric01 trial, said: \"Once patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer progress following initial treatment with an anti-HER2 regimen, there are limited treatment options and no approved HER2-targeted therapies. Based upon the compelling results of the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial, ENHERTU has the potential to become a new standard of care for these patients.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Baselga, Executive Vice President, R&D Oncology, said: \"In DESTINY-Gastric01, the response rate was more than three times higher with ENHERTU versus chemotherapy. Additionally, more than half of patients treated with ENHERTU were alive at one year compared to less than a third with chemotherapy. In addition to the impressive results we saw in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in DESTINY-Breast01, these results in gastric cancer may help further define the role of ENHERTU in transforming patient outcomes across multiple HER2-targetable cancers.\"\n\nAntoine Yver Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo, said: \"ENHERTU is the first HER2-directed therapy to show an improvement in overall survival for patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. These data are encouraging and meaningful since patients with advanced gastric cancer have limited therapeutic options once they progress and face markedly high mortality rates. We are working with regulatory authorities to bring ENHERTU to patients with metastatic gastric cancer as quickly as possible.\"\n\nENHERTU showed a confirmed disease control rate (DCR) of 85.7% versus 62.5% and a median confirmed duration of response (DoR) of 11.3 months versus 3.9 months with chemotherapy.\n\nSummary of results:i\n\nENHERTU\n\nmonotherapyii\n\nInvestigator's choice of\n\nchemotherapy\n\n(paclitaxel or irinotecan)\n\nn=119\n\nn=56\n\nConfirmed ORR (%)iii,iv,v\n\n(95% CI %)\n\n42.9\n\n(33.8-52.3; p<0.0001)\n\n12.5\n\n(5.2-24.1)\n\nCR (%)\n\n8.4\n\n0\n\nPR (%)\n\n34.5\n\n12.5\n\nSD (%)\n\n42.9\n\n50.0\n\nConfirmed DCR (%)vi\n\n(95% CI)\n\n85.7\n\n(78.1-91.5)\n\n62.5\n\n(48.5-75.1)\n\nConfirmed median DoR (months)\n\n(95% CI)\n\n11.3\n\n(5.6-NE)\n\n3.9\n\n(3.0-4.9)\n\nCI, confidence interval; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease i\n\nData cutoff was November 8, 2019.\n\nii\n\nENHERTU 6.4mg/kg.\n\niii\n\nAs assessed by independent central review.\n\niv\n\nORR is (CR + PR).\n\nv\n\nConfirmed ORR represents responses confirmed by a follow-up scan \u2265four weeks after initial CR/PR; unconfirmed ORR is the primary endpoint of the trial (51.3% [95% CI 41.9-60.5] versus 14.3% [95% CI 6.4-26.2]; p<0.0001). Both confirmed and unconfirmed ORR were assessed by independent central review.\n\nvi\n\nDCR is (CR + PR + SD).\n\nThe safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Gastric01 was consistent with that observed in Phase I gastric cancer trial and previously reported ENHERTU trials. The most common Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (51.2%), anemia (37.6%), decreased white blood cell count (20.8%) and decreased appetite (16.8%). There were 12 cases (9.6%) of confirmed treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis as determined by an independent review. The majority were Grade 1 or 2 with two Grade 3, one Grade 4, and no ILD-related deaths (Grade 5).\n\nThe results were presented during the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program and simultaneously published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nENHERTU was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the US for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab based on data from the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial and Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for patients with gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer. ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial. ENHERTU has not been approved in the United States for HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.\n\nFDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU\n\nENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.\n\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.\n\nContraindications\n\nNone.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis\n\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).\n\nAdvise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in \u226428 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., \u22650.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., \u22651 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).\n\nNeutropenia\n\nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.\n\nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3\u00baC or a sustained temperature of \u226538\u00baC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.\n\nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction\n\nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).\n\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.\n\nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (frequency \u226520%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).\n\nUse in Specific Populations\n\nPregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were \u226565 years and 5% were \u226575 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged \u226565 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1-877-437-7763 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.\n\nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING, and Medication Guide.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nGastric Cancer\n\nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality with a five-year survival rate of 5% for metastatic disease; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2018 and 783,000 deaths. In the US, it is estimated that 27,600 new cases of gastric cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and more than 11,000 people will die from the disease.\n\nApproximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive. HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage, but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest. Recommended 1st-line treatment for HER2-positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve survival outcomes when added to chemotherapy. For gastric cancer that progresses on 1st-line treatment, there are no other approved HER2-targeted medicines.\n\nDESTINY-Gastric01\n\nDESTINY-Gastric01 is a registrational Phase II, open-label, randomized, multi-center trial testing the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU versus investigator's choice chemotherapy in a primary cohort of 188 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2-expressing, advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) who have progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5-FU) and platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with ENHERTU 6.4mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR, as assessed by independent central review. ORR, or tumor response rate, represents the percentage of patients whose disease decreased and/or disappears. OS was a key secondary endpoint to be statistically evaluated hierarchically at a prespecified interim analysis if the primary endpoint was statistically significant. Other secondary endpoints include PFS, DoR, DCR and confirmed ORR assessed in those responses confirmed by a follow-up scan of at least 4 weeks after initial independent central review.\n\nENHERTU\n\nENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the US only) is a HER2-directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca's ADC scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (\"payload\") to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.\n\nENHERTU Clinical Development\n\nA comprehensive development program is underway globally with six registrational trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2-driven cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.\n\nCollaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\n\nIn March 2019, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for manufacturing and supply.\n\nAbout AstraZeneca in Oncology\n\nAstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in Oncology and offers a quickly-growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients' lives and the Company's future. With at least six new medicines to be launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, we are committed to advance Oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to our core capabilities, we actively pursue innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by our investment in Acerta Pharma in hematology.\n\nBy harnessing the power of four scientific platforms - Immuno-Oncology, Tumor Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates - and by championing the development of personalized combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.\n\nAbout AstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three main therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism and Respiratory and Immunology. The Company also is selectively active in the areas of autoimmunity, neuroscience and infection. AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

There are currently no medicines approved specifically for the treatment of HER2m NSCLC, which affects approximately 2-4% of patients with NSCLC.\n\nThe primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR), assessed by independent central review, was 61.9% for patients treated with ENHERTU monotherapy (6.4mg/kg). Patients achieved a disease control rate (DCR) of 90.5% with an estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) of 14.0 months. Median duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS) had not yet been reached at the time of data cut-off.\n\nEgbert F. Smit, Professor, MD, Department of Thoracic Oncology at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands and principal investigator in the Phase II DESTINY-Lung01 trial, said: \"While there have been important advances in the treatment of lung cancer over the past decade, there are still patients whose tumors continue to progress despite treatment with newer targeted agents or immunotherapies. Understanding additional molecular targets for treatment, such as HER2, is critical to advancing treatment options for these patients and the results seen in the DESTINY-Lung01 trial are very encouraging.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Baselga, Executive Vice President, R&D Oncology, said: \"The results seen with ENHERTU in patients with metastatic HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer are very exciting and highlight the role ENHERTU may have as a new treatment option for patients facing a devastating prognosis. Further, the results demonstrate the potential of ENHERTU to treat another tumor type among patients with extremely high unmet need.\"\n\nAntoine Yver, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo, said: \"While the role of anti-HER2 treatment is well-established in breast and gastric cancers, there are no HER2-directed therapies specifically approved for lung cancer. These results validate HER2 mutations as actionable targets in lung cancer and offer further evidence that ENHERTU has the potential to transform outcomes for patients across a spectrum of HER2-targetable cancers.\"\n\nSummary of results\n\nHER2m Total Evaluable (n=42)i\n\nConfirmed ORR (%) (95% CI)ii, iii\n\n61.9 (45.6-76.4)\n\nCR (%)\n\n2.4\n\nPR (%)\n\n59.5\n\nSD (%)\n\n28.6\n\nDCR (%) (95% CI)iv\n\n90.5 (77.4-97.3)\n\nMedian DoR (months) (95% CI)\n\nNE (5.3-NE)\n\nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI)\n\n14.0 (6.4-14.0)\n\nMedian OS (months) (95% CI)\n\nNE (11.8 - NE)\n\nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; NE, not estimable\n\ni ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg\n\nii As assessed by independent central review.\n\niii ORR is (CR + PR)\n\niv DCR is (CR+PR+SD)\n\nPatients were treated with a median of two prior therapies (1-6) with most receiving platinum-based chemotherapy (90.5%) and anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 treatment (54.8%). Median treatment duration was 7.76 months (0.7-14.3) with a median duration of follow-up of 8.0 months (1.4-14.2). As of data cut-off on November 25, 2019, 45.2% of patients with HER2m NSCLC remained on treatment.\n\nThe overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Lung01 was consistent with that seen in the Phase I lung cancer trial and previously reported ENHERTU trials. The most common Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (26.2%) and anemia (16.7%). There were five cases (11.9%) of confirmed treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis as determined by independent review. All ILD and pneumonitis cases were Grade 2. One Grade 1 ILD is still undergoing adjudication.\n\nResults from the DESTINY-Lung01 trial were presented today during the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program on May 29-31, 2020. Several other presentations featured during the ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program will showcase AstraZeneca's leadership in lung cancer across early and late-stage disease and reinforce the Company's biomarker-driven approach.\n\nENHERTU was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the US for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and whose disease progressed on or after platinum-based therapy. ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial. ENHERTU has not been approved in the United States for non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nFDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU\n\nENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.\n\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.\n\nContraindications\n\nNone.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis\n\nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).\n\nAdvise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in \u226428 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., \u22650.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., \u22651 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).\n\nNeutropenia\n\nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.\n\nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3\u00baC or a sustained temperature of \u226538\u00baC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.\n\nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction\n\nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).\n\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.\n\nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (frequency \u226520%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).\n\nUse in Specific Populations\n\nPregnancy: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were \u226565 years and 5% were \u226575 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients \u226565 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged \u226565 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1-877-437-7763 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.\n\nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING, and Medication Guide.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nHER2\n\nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.\n\nOther HER2 gene alterations (called HER2 mutations) have been identified in NSCLC, specifically adenocarcinomas, as distinct molecular targets. Approximately 2-4% of patients with NSCLC have HER2 mutations, which have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis.\n\nNSCLC\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths globally. In the US, it is estimated that 228,820 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and more than 135,000 people will die from the disease.\n\nLung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and SCLC, with 80-85% classified as NSCLC. Within NSCLC, patients are classified as squamous, representing 25-30% of patients, or non-squamous, the most common type representing approximately 70-75% of NSCLC patients. Stage IV is the most advanced form of lung cancer and is often referred to as metastatic disease. For these patients with metastatic disease, prognosis is particularly poor, as only 6-10% will be alive five years after diagnosis. The introduction of targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors in recent years has improved outcomes for patients with advanced NSCLC; however, new approaches are needed for those who are not eligible for available treatments, or whose cancer continues to progress. Currently, no medicine is specifically approved for patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC.\n\nDESTINY-Lung01\n\nDESTINY-Lung01 is a global, Phase II, open-label, multicenter, two-cohort trial testing the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in 170 patients with HER2mor HER2-overexpressing, defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+, unresectable and/or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients had progressed after one or more systemic therapies including chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy or immunotherapy. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by independent central review. ORR, or tumor response rate, represents the percentage of patient whose disease decreased and/or disappears. Key secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS and OS.\n\nENHERTU\n\nENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the US only) is a HER2-directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca's ADC scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (\"payload\") to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.\n\nENHERTU Clinical Development\n\nA comprehensive development program is underway globally with six registrational trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2-driven cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.\n\nCollaboration between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\n\nIn March 2019, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for manufacturing and supply.\n\nAbout AstraZeneca in Oncology\n\nAstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage in Oncology and offers a quickly-growing portfolio of new medicines that has the potential to transform patients' lives and the Company's future. With at least six new medicines to be launched between 2014 and 2020, and a broad pipeline of small molecules and biologics in development, we are committed to advance Oncology as a key growth driver for AstraZeneca focused on lung, ovarian, breast and blood cancers. In addition to our core capabilities, we actively pursue innovative partnerships and investments that accelerate the delivery of our strategy, as illustrated by our investment in Acerta Pharma in hematology.\n\nBy harnessing the power of four scientific platforms - Immuno-Oncology, Tumor Drivers and Resistance, DNA Damage Response and Antibody Drug Conjugates - and by championing the development of personalized combinations, AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer treatment and one day eliminate cancer as a cause of death.\n\nAbout AstraZeneca\n\nAstraZeneca is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three main therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism and Respiratory and Immunology. The Company also is selectively active in the areas of autoimmunity, neuroscience and infection. AstraZeneca operates in over 100 countries and its innovative medicines are used by millions of patients worldwide.

Coccio, Chairman and CEO of Sono-Tek, commented, \"During fiscal 2020, our strategy to expand the addressable market for our unique ultrasonic coating technology continued to gain traction, reflecting our ongoing development of new, complex solutions for the Alternative Energy, Microelectronics and Medical markets. These more complex solutions address high value applications for our customers and provide economically compelling alternatives to traditional coating technologies. We focused our sales and marketing resources on these targeted opportunities and, combined with strong market conditions, generated a sales increase of 32.3% to $15.3 million for the fiscal year.\n\n\"The strong sales growth and 240 basis point improvement in gross margin increased our operating leverage and drove a nearly seven-fold increase in net income to a record $1.1 million for the year. We achieved this even as we continued to invest in advancing our technologies through new product development and adding to our experienced staff of application engineers to further fuel growth.\n\n\"Our strong pipeline of opportunities gained momentum as well. This momentum, combined with our record yearend backlog of $3.5 million, would normally provide us with confidence in our expectations for significant revenue growth in fiscal 2021. However, COVID-19 broke out just as we began our new fiscal year in March 2020, making the full year's revenue more challenging to forecast. With a strong pre-COVID-19 backlog in place, we now anticipate achieving a revenue increase of approximately 21% for the first quarter of the new fiscal year, which ends May 31, 2020. This is slightly less than our prior forecasted Q1 growth, and results from a delayed shipment of 1 -2 weeks, due to COVID-19 related schedule challenges. It is also possible to forecast an improved second quarter, with revenue growth of 15% - 20% compared to last fiscal year, as our business has evolved to larger projects with longer lead times. At this time though, we don't believe that we will be able to maintain the same pace of growth in the last two quarters of the year compared to the same period of last fiscal year, due to the current economic uncertainty coupled with lower GDP and higher unemployment. Therefore, the negative impacts of COVID-19 on our business are most likely to occur in the second half of FY2021 and first half of FY2022, unless the lockdowns ease on our customers and their consumers soon. We are continuing to work hard to accelerate our growth strategies and develop new business to offset the potential COVID-19 related declines and firmly believe that we will thrive in spite of the current economic issues due to our market leadership and successful history of developing our target markets,\" concluded Dr. Coccio.\n\nFiscal 2020 Review (Results compared with fiscal 2019)\n\nThe introduction of several new high value machine offerings, in combination with our continued investment in application engineering capabilities, drove sales up 32% to $15,355,000, compared with the prior fiscal year.\n\nIn fiscal 2020, approximately 71% of sales originated outside of the United States and Canada. This compares with 65% in fiscal 2019. The geographic shift was mostly due to higher sales to Asian and European markets.\n\nGross profit and operating margins for fiscal 2020 increased to 47.6% and 7.3%, respectively, from 45.2% and 0.71%, respectively, for fiscal 2019. The higher gross profit margin reflects a strong year in providing complex coating solutions with increased applications engineering value to our customers, as well as a shift in the mix of our markets. The shift in mix reflects increased sales to the microelectronics and medical sectors, whose products contain the highest value of our applications expertise and contributed to increased margins as well.\n\nSono-Tek achieved net income of $1.1 million, or $0.07 per share, basic and diluted, compared with $0.06 million, or $0.01 per share, basic and diluted, in the prior year. Weighted average fully diluted common shares outstanding were 15,359,088 and 15,218,913 in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.\n\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Review (Results compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019)\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Overview\n\nNet cash generated in operating activities was $3,254,000 in fiscal 2020, compared with usage of $109,000 cash in fiscal 2019. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 increased to $722,000 compared with $547,000 in the prior fiscal year.\n\nOn February 29, 2020, the Company had total debt of $708,000, down $163,000 from fiscal 2019 year-end.

Patients on placebo lost 188mL lung volume over a year, while patients on nintedanib lost 81mL. This was measured as adjusted annual rate of decline over 52 weeks and meant that nintedanib slowed the lung function decline by 57% versus placebo.2 The treatment effect of nintedanib in slowing FVC decline compared with placebo seen in INBUILD\u00ae was consistent for all patients, regardless of the fibrotic pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and it was also consistent with the results in nintedanib trials studying patients with IPF and SSc-ILD.2,9,10,11\n\nIn the trial, nintedanib was associated with numerical reductions in the risk of acute exacerbation or death versus placebo.2 Treatment benefit may also be accompanied by reduced worsening of patient-reported outcomes such as dyspnea and cough.12 In addition, the safety profile observed in INBUILD\u00ae was consistent to what has been seen in IPF and SSc-ILD patients treated with nintedanib previously.2\n\n~ENDS~\n\nPlease click on the link for 'Notes to Editors' and 'References': http://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/press-release/chmpopinionnintedanibildpf", "dtype": "pr", "published_on": "2020-05-29T18:05:00Z", "uri": "p-6085343340", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200529005287/en/Boehringer-Ingelheim-receives-positive-CHMP-opinion-nintedanib/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-WFAllVCLJFCqzlmaJ8DKHU4plfPZtlGYRDUHCSmgbii6XkLWuQZD-HgGRnjQvCyg3iCfEFIaJW7-otp9V1XQiK2eHTJy3ZqOEt7kKgLu20J"}], "6085335950": [912950897, {"pk": 912950897, "name": "Eastern Property Holdings Limited (EPH):First quarter 2020 Financial Update", "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "text": "29 May 2020, Road Town, Tortola, BVI\n\nKEY EVENTS\n\nIn March 2020, the Company received EUR 204.7 million by issuance of subordinated notes to its two largest shareholders at an interest rate of 3.5% p.a. The management intends to use the funds for the acquisition of properties in Western Europe in order to further strengthen the Group's business and follow its strategy to invest in premium quality income producing commercial property assets in Europe.Arbat sales have been continued: a few more apartments and parking lots were sold in Q1 2020.Leases with the Company's top tenants (Chanel and Richemont Group) have been extended.As a subsequent event, in April 2020 the Company acquired 89.9% of interest in the Nhow Hotel in Berlin, Germany. The property had been completed in 2010 and comprises approximately 20,160 sqm, including 304 rooms, 86 underground & 39 surface parking spaces, a spa, restaurant and two music studios.\n\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe Company's rental properties demonstrate stable performance and generate sufficient cash to cover the Company's operating expenses and service the debt.RUB and EUR, major currencies of the Group's operations, continue to be volatile and affect the Company's operating results and net asset value. Dramatic drop in oil prices in Q1 2020 resulted in deterioration of RUB against major global currencies US$ and EUR. RUB and EUR weakened against US$ by approximately 26% and 2% since last reported date of 31 December 2019. In average, for Q1 2020 RUB depreciated by 6% against US$ and EUR - by 3% against US$ in comparison to Q1 2019.\n\nThe above key events led to the following main changes in the Company's financial results for Q1 2020 and financial position at 31 March 2020. The comparative data below is given from the Group's published financial statements as of 31 December 2019.\n\nNET RENTAL INCOME\n\nDuring Q1 2020 EPH rental properties generated US$ 14 million of net rental income (Q1 2019: US$19 million).\n\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACT\n\nAll Company's properties are valued twice a year - as of the end of June and December when the Group publish its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. So, as of 31 March 2020 the values in the currency of revaluation (US$ for Russia and EUR for Germany and Austria) did not change. For Russian properties, the Company recalculated RUB equivalent of US$ values of the properties at the rate effective at 31 March 2020 and recognised FX gain on revaluation in the amount of $153.4 million. The gain was fully compensated by negative FX recognised in the income statement on the intra-group debt and external debt denominated in US$ and EUR and by negative change in currency translation adjustment recognized directly in equity; so, the overall impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the reporting period is a gain of $0.4 million.\n\nRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SALES\n\nIn Q1 2020, net gain on sales of apartments and parking lots in Arbat, 24 and Arbat, 39 residential complexes amounted to US$0.5 million. Proceeds from sales amounted to US$ 5.1 million.\n\nINVESTMENT PROPERTY\n\nDecrease in US$ value of investment property from US$1 007 million to US$ 999 million is caused by compression in US$ equivalent of fair values of European properties due to US$/EUR rate depreciation since fair value for these properties is denominated in EUR.\n\nARBAT RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES\n\nArbat residential properties in Moscow are valued at cost and denominated in RUB. It's US$ value equivalent US$ 94 million decreased from US$124 million upon recalculation at depreciated US$/RUB rate as well as due to the sale of several premises in Q1 2020 with US$ 4.6 million cost.\n\nCASH AND BORROWINGS\n\nIncrease in cash balance up to US$ 253 million from US$29 million corresponds to the funds raised in March from issuance of subordinated notes.\n\nEastern Property Holdings Ltd. is an investment company listed on SIX Swiss Exchange which holds interest in office, residential and retail properties.

The results, which have been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) submitted in March, are being featured today at the ASCO 2020 Virtual Scientific Program in a poster titled, \"TIVO-3: Final OS analysis of a phase III, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study to compare tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC)\" (abstract 5062). A copy of the poster will be available at the ASCO virtual meeting beginning today, May 29, 2020, at 8:00 AM ET. The poster and accompanying oral presentation by Sumanta (Monty) Pal, MD, Associate Clinical Professor, Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, and Co-director, Kidney Cancer Program, at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, can be viewed at www.aveooncology.com.\n\nAs previously announced, the TIVO-3 trial met the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) (HR=0.73; p=0.02) and the secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) (18% vs. 8%; p=0.02). The final OS hazard ratio (HR), which assesses the overall relative risk of death, was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.75-1.25; p=0.82), favoring tivozanib and improving from the previously reported interim HR of 0.99. Updated median OS, representing a single point in time in the OS curve, was 16.4 months for tivozanib (95% CI: 13.4-22.2) and 19.2 months for sorafenib (95% CI: 15.0-24.2). These OS HR results are similar to those of prior VEGFR TKI vs. VEGFR TKI studies in RCC.1-4\n\nTivozanib was found to be generally well-tolerated, with grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials. The most common AE in patients receiving tivozanib was hypertension (38% vs. 25% for sorafenib, of treated patients), an AE known to reflect effective VEGF pathway inhibition. Infrequent but severe AEs reported in greater number in the tivozanib arm were thrombotic events (5% vs. 4% for sorafenib, of treated patients) similar to those observed in previous tivozanib studies. Dose reductions and interruptions due to AEs were significantly lower for tivozanib vs. sorafenib, despite nearly double the average number of cycles initiated for the tivozanib arm (11.9 months vs. 6.7 months for sorafenib), treatment related AEs leading to permanent discontinuation were 8% for tivozanib vs. 15% for sorafenib.\n\n\"We believe the TIVO-3 data demonstrate a favorable risk/benefit profile for tivozanib in the growing population of patients who have relapsed or become refractory to multiple lines of therapy, including checkpoint inhibitors,\" said Dr. Pal. \"The lack of clinical data to guide treatment decisions in a robust, evidence-based manner in this setting is a serious and growing unmet medical need, particularly as this population continues to grow thanks to improved treatment in earlier lines. TIVO-3 provides the first positive superiority study to help guide this important treatment decision and, furthermore, offers this highly refractory patient population a favorable tolerability profile as indicated by fewer dose reductions, interruptions and discontinuations over a less selective VEGFR TKI in sorafenib.\"\n\n\"This outcome marks a significant milestone in a long journey to see tivozanib fulfill its potential, and is a critical step forward in our goal to improve both efficacy outcomes and patient experience for individuals living with cancer,\" said Michael Bailey, president and chief executive officer of AVEO. \"Tivozanib has the potential to define highly refractory kidney cancer treatment, an area with no current evidence-based standard of care. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the FDA as we work toward a marketing authorization decision, and we will continue to build on our foundation for commercial readiness. We owe our deepest gratitude to the patients and their families for participating in the tivozanib clinical program, and to the healthcare professionals who have continued to believe in the potential of tivozanib.\"\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nIn connection with this announcement, AVEO will host a conference call and audio webcast today, May 29, 2020, at 8:30 am Eastern Time. Dr. Pal will join the AVEO management team to review the data announced today. The call can be accessed by dialing (844) 882-7841 (U.S. and Canada) or (574) 990-9828 (international).

The webcast will be recorded and available for replay on AVEO's website for two weeks.\n\nAbout Tivozanib (FOTIVDA\u00ae)\n\nTivozanib (FOTIVDA\u00ae) is an oral, once-daily, next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) discovered by Kyowa Kirin and approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand and Iceland. It is a potent, selective and long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities, potentially resulting in improved efficacy and minimal dose modifications.5,6 Tivozanib is being studied in the TIVO-3 trial, which is supporting a regulatory submission of tivozanib in the U.S. seeking marketing approval as a treatment for relapsed or refractory RCC. Tivozanib has been shown to significantly reduce regulatory T-cell production in preclinical models7 and has demonstrated synergy in combination with nivolumab (anti PD-1) in a Phase 2 study in RCC8. Tivozanib has been investigated in several tumor types, including renal cell, hepatocellular, colorectal, ovarian and breast cancers.\n\nAbout AVEO\n\nAVEO is developing an oncology pipeline designed to provide a better life for patients with cancer. AVEO's strategy is to focus its resources toward development and commercialization of its product candidates in North America, while leveraging partnerships to support development and commercialization in other geographies. AVEO's lead candidate, tivozanib (FOTIVDA\u00ae), is approved in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand and Iceland for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. AVEO is working to develop and commercialize tivozanib in North America as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers. Ficlatuzumab (HGF MAb) is in a Phase 2 clinical trial in head and neck cancer and has reported early clinical data in pancreatic cancer. AVEO's earlier-stage pipeline includes several monoclonal antibodies in oncology development, including AV-203 (anti-ErbB3 MAb), AV-380 (GDF15 MAb) and AV-353 (Notch 3 MAb).

You get to the due date, you want to have that baby. Any day after is frustrating.\"\n\nAs New York tries to get its economy going again, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has divided the state into 10 regions that can start to reopen businesses in phases.\n\nAll of the state except for New York City is now at a phase that allows manufacturers to bring employees back to work and lets retailers operate with only curbside pickup.\n\nThe next phase is more expansive, allowing offices to bring back more workers, hair salons and barbershops to reopen and retailers to bring some customers into stores.\n\nThe governor's executive orders leave it up to his administration to decide when a region has met the state's standards for lifting restrictions. The rules guiding exactly when counties can move from one reopening phase to another have been less clear, though the state set the minimum amount of time between phases at two weeks, saying that gap was needed to let officials monitor infection rates.\n\nLast week, Cuomo announced the hiring of two experts to analyze the data and consult on reopening decisions.\n\n\"We'll give the experts all the data. And if they say we should move forward, we'll move forward,\" the Democrat said on public radio Thursday.\n\nOnondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon said Thursday that data indicated that his central New York county, which includes Syracuse, meets the state's phase 2 reopening benchmarks, but acknowledged he had yet to get the green light from the governor's office\n\n\"Nobody has ever said phase two isn't a go for Friday,\" McMahon said. \"Everybody has been talking about Friday since we got to phase one.\"\n\nNew York City appears to be on track to begin loosening restrictions in June, but residents who don't yet feel comfortable commuting by subway may have to improvise, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday.\n\n\"We are trying to get the subways and buses to be as clean and safe as possible in a really, really imperfect situation,\" de Blasio said. \"If people want to use cars because that's what makes them comfortable, and obviously there still is a lot less traffic on the road, then they're going to use cars.\"\n\nDe Blasio said the city is on target to enter the first phase of the reopening process sometime in the next two weeks, which would bring an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 people back to work.\n\nBusinesses normally rely on public transportation to get their employees to work in a city where fewer than half of households own a car.\n\nFears of the coronavirus have sent ridership on city buses and subways plummeting, but a return could mean crowded cars again and little hope of social distancing.\n\nDe Blasio said the city is providing 2 million masks for businesses reopening and will also offer training and a worker protection hot line.\n\nThompson reported from Buffalo.

The individual loans, which could reach $600 billion, will technically be made by banks. But the Fed will buy 85% to 95% of each loan, thereby reducing the risk to banks and freeing them to do more lending.\n\nPowell said that Main Street will make its first loans in a \"few days.\" He has previously set June 1 as the target, or soon after.\n\nHe noted that the complexity of the program goes far beyond the Fed's usual lending efforts, which typically involve buying bonds. The Main Street program will consist of unique loans to individual businesses.\n\n\"It is far and away the biggest challenge of the 11 facilities we have set up,\" Powell said.\n\nSpeaking in an online question-and-answer session with Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Fed, Powell also said he worries that a second wave of the coronavirus, perhaps in the fall, would damage consumer confidence and weaken any economic recovery.\n\nFor the economy to fully recover, Powell said, Americans must be confident that they can shop, eat at restaurants or visit public places without risking infection. For that reason, he said, tracking the spread of the virus is, if anything, more important than economic data in gauging any recovery.\n\n\"A second wave would really undermine public confidence and might make for a significantly longer and weaker recovery,\" the chairman said.\n\nAddressing the Main Street Lending program, Powell said its primary goal is to help preserve jobs or make it easier for workers to find new ones. Companies with up to 15,000 employees or $5 billion in revenue are eligible.\n\n\"That's the point of this exercise,\" he said.\n\nYet unlike with the government's small business lending program, borrowers from Main Street won't be required to keep their employees. Instead, they will be required to make \"commercially reasonable\" efforts to hold onto their staffs. That has brought criticism from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has backed the Main Street effort, haven't done enough to ensure that the program will in fact protect jobs.\n\nPowell said Friday that the Main Street loans are intended for companies that were healthy before the pandemic hit and that will likely remain viable. But many Fed watchers have argued that the program won't be very effective unless it is willing to make risky loans that might fail. The Treasury Department has provided $75 billion to offset losses.\n\nMnuchin had initially indicated that the Treasury wanted all that money to be repaid, which could have forced the Fed to be too cautious. But earlier this month Mnuchin reversed himself and said the Treasury was willing to take losses on the Main Street loans.\n\nThe Fed has reacted to the sharp downturn in the economy by slashing short-term interest rates to near zero and buying $2 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds to keep credit markets functioning. It has also announced 11 separate lending programs that are intended to support borrowing by businesses, banks and households.\n\nRoughly 30 million Americans -- about one in five workers -- are receiving unemployment aid, a result of widespread business shutdowns and record drops in consumer spending. All states have begun phased re-openings of their economies, which has produced some modest bounce-back in consumer spending. Still, Powell has previously said the unemployment rate is likely to peak at between 20% and 25% in May or June.\n\nIn his most recent public comments, Powell has underscored that the United States is gripped by an economic shock \"without modern precedent\" and that Congress must consider providing further financial aid soon to support states, localities, businesses and individuals to prevent an even deeper recession.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-29T18:01:00Z", "uri": "6085339539", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/powell-fed-begin-challenging-main-street-lending-70955294"}], "p-6085339096": [473403817, {"sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "published_on": "2020-05-29T18:01:00Z", "name": "India Iron Ore Mining Industry Outlook to 2024 - Impact of COVID-19 on Iron Ore Demand - ResearchAndMarkets.com", "dtype": "pr", "pk": 473403817, "text": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The \"India Iron Ore Mining to 2024\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nThis report comprehensively covers Indian reserves of iron ore, historic and forecast trends in the country's iron ore production and the key active, exploration and development iron ore mines and projects. The report also analyses factors affecting the country's demand for iron ore and profiles the major iron ore producers.\n\nIndia's iron ore production is estimated to have risen by 14.2% in 2019, to reach 234.9Mt, owing to the acceleration in mine production for several non-captive mines - especially from merchant miners due to the expiration of leases in March this year. Production in 2020 is expected to decline to 205.7Mt; a delay in mineral auctions in Odisha, coupled with regulatory approvals, will be of major concern for Indian miners.\n\nProduction over the forecast period is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.2%, to reach 271.2Mt in 2024. This growth can be attributed to the commencement of new projects and the expansion of existing ones, such as the Kumaraswamy mine, the Daitari and Gandhamardhan mines and the Chiria iron ore mine.\n\nImpact of COVID-19\n\nThe report analyses impact of coronavirus on India's iron ore mining industry, with details of reserves, production, consumption trends and forecasts, the competitive landscape and listing of the major active, exploration and development projects.

Intrusion has been fighting cybercrime for more than 20 years and as a result has the largest database of historical internet data.).\n\nFifth paragraph, third sentence of release dated May 27, 2020, should read: Prior to that, he served as CIO of the United States Department of Agriculture, where he was responsible for designing a new, 10-layer cybersecurity architecture that protected more than 100,000 employees and billions of dollars. (instead of: Prior to that, he served as CIO in the federal government, where he was responsible for designing a new, 10-layer cybersecurity architecture that protected more than 100,000 employees and billions of dollars.)\n\nThe corrected release reads:\n\nINTRUSION INC. APPOINTS JACK BLOUNT AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nIntrusion Inc. (OTCQB: INTZ) (\"Intrusion\") announced today that its Board of Directors has named Jack B. Blount to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Blount was also appointed as a director of the company. Michael L. Paxton, former Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, retains the positions of Chairman, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer.\n\n\"We are excited to have Jack join Intrusion. He is an experienced executive with a tremendous amount of experience,\" stated Michael L. Paxton, Vice President and CFO of Intrusion.\n\n\"I have never been more energized and excited about joining a company than I am now about Intrusion,\" stated Jack B. Blount, President and CEO of Intrusion. \"According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the world suffered $3 trillion in cybercrime losses in 2019, with that loss predicted to reach $6 trillion in 2021. Intrusion has been fighting cybercrime for more than 20 years and as a result has the largest database of historical internet data. By combining that data and expertise with machine learning, we are creating an affordable cybercrime prevention tool that I fully expect will change the landscape of cybersecurity.\"\n\nAs recently pointed out in the Cyberspace Solarium Commission report, \"Our country is at risk, not only from a catastrophic cyberattack but from millions of daily intrusions disrupting everything from financial transactions to the inner workings of our electoral system. China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea all probe U.S. critical infrastructure with impunity. Criminals leverage globally connected networks to steal assets from individuals, companies, and governments.\"\n\nBlount had an extensive career in technology as a visionary in the personal computer, local area networking, ERP, mobile computing, big data, cybersecurity, and AI fields. Most recently, Blount founded a strategic consultancy for enterprise, startup and federal government organizations. Prior to that, he served as CIO of the United States Department of Agriculture, where he was responsible for designing a new, 10-layer cybersecurity architecture that protected more than 100,000 employees and billions of dollars.\n\nBlount began his career as an engineer at IBM and was then recruited from IBM for the role of SVP of Business Development at Novell in the 1980s, where he helped expand its business from $50M to $2B in just six years. He has served as the CTO, COO, and CEO of eight technology, turnaround companies and has served on twelve technology company Boards of Directors, five of which were public companies, and he held the role of Chairman of five of those companies. Blount has conducted business in more than 40 countries and has been a speaker at many public conferences in China, France, Germany, Norway, Russia, and the United States. He graduated from Southern Methodist University with a degree in Mathematics and did his graduate MBA studies while working at IBM.\n\nInterested investors can access a call later today to discuss Mr. Blount's appointment at 10:00 A.M.

It is so easy and simple to set up. It has helped us transition to our virtual offering, almost seamlessly. We can now offer more personal training sessions and group training classes. Due to lockdown more people are aware that they need to keep moving and we are actually busier than before!\n\n\"We have a client retention rate of 99.5% which is incredible. We have even taken on more clients. Previously we were restricted by geographical location but now have clients from further afield, including Devon, Wales and Slovakia.

They are the relatable ones, the ones fans scream at and for, the ones who have their jerseys or baseball cards bought. They are the emotional bond to the game. Not the owners. They're a pack of men behind the curtain.\n\nWhich is why Snell and Bauer operating on their own runs counter to the union's better interests -- and focus. A focus largely headed by the measured comments of Max Scherzer, or other prominent union representatives like St. Louis' Andrew Miller.\n\nSnell kicked off the what-not-to-do examples when he said the short-sighted and ill-informed, if accurate, \"I gotta get my money\" two weeks ago. That notion fed right into the perspective of player greed and the owners virtually high-fived. They stretched their inherent public relations lead thanks to Snell's misstep.\n\nBauer made his inappropriate contribution where measured response goes to dies: Twitter. Bauer tweeted, \"Hearing a LOT of rumors about a certain player agent meddling in MLBPA affairs. If true -- and at this point, these are only rumors -- I have one thing to say...Scott Boras, rep your clients however you want to, but keep your damn personal agenda out of union business.\"\n\nThe rumors were true according to an Associated Press report. Boras sent a memo to his clients -- three of whom, including Scherzer, are on the MLBPA's eight-player executive subcommittee -- which advised them not to \"bail out\" the owners. Boras argued the owners made bad financial decisions outside of baseball and the players' salaries should not be a path to financial recuperation.\n\nSo, yes, Boras -- the sports' most powerful agent -- is giving his clients his opinion of how to proceed. This is neither surprising nor unbecoming conduct. He negotiates for billions of dollars on an annual basis and does much of it while bending public perception. He's more someone to listen to in these scenarios than tune out.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE NATIONALS TALK PODCAST\n\nBauer's desire to keep another agent out of union business is not a sin unto itself. His agent, Rachel Luba, is not part of the process. It's understandable he wants to curtail other agents.\n\nHowever, deciding to blast a tweet about it left other union members shaking their heads. And it's in direct contrast to the approach Scherzer and others on the sub-committee have taken.\n\nScherzer's late-night tweet was a measured, considered strike, in keeping with his general approach to public statements. Union work is second only to his primary function -- make all his starts -- when he views his job. He wants to relay specific points at specific times following forethought and consideration of the ripple effects. Basically the opposite of Bauer.\n\nLook back to what Scherzer said about negotiations between the players and league in late March when they came together for an initial deal. Think about the points he makes here to NBC Sports Washington and how Bauer's tweet undermines the priorities.\n\n\"All the players were very well connected,\" Scherzer said then. \"For having such a significant issue -- I don't think baseball has ever been shut down, so we were navigating a situation that was constantly changing every 24 hours as we were trying to understand what was going to happen. And, we were trying to understand what we wanted in a deal.\n\n\"I got to commend the rest of the players in the league and the other players in the executive committee for everybody stepping up, being connected and sharing a voice. Trying to get as educated as possible to communicate it to the whole 1,200-player group. Try to get everybody's desires of what they wanted in the deal, done. I thought we really acted extremely well together with our union leadership of coming up with what our wants were and working together as one to be able to get that done.\"\n\nThis, again, is a key concept for the players. They need to be bonded in private, and even more so in public, which is why consistent messaging matters. Scherzer is among the cat herders here. No owner will be speaking out of turn. The players would be well-served to join them.", "uri": "6085327808", "url": "https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/nationals/max-scherzer-continues-try-steer-union-united-front"}], "6085325577": [390267262, {"sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:45:00Z", "name": "Expo body formally approves one-year delay to Expo 2020 Dubai", "dtype": "news", "pk": 390267262, "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - The World Expo awarding body said on Friday its general assembly had approved a one-year postponement of Expo 2020 Dubai due to difficulties posed by the coronavirus pandemic, and the event would now start in October 2021.\n\nEarlier this month the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) said that the required consent of two-thirds of its 170 member states to delay the Expo had been surpassed.

The Icagen team has been a great addition to Ligand's business.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to extend and expand our collaboration with Roche and its drug discovery team in Basel,\" said Icagen Site Head Douglas Krafte, PhD. \"Our initial neurology program with Roche continues to make great progress and we hope to assist Roche in bringing multiple meaningful therapies to patients in areas of neurological disease with major unmet needs through both our initial and this new program.\"\n\nTerms of Expanded Icagen and Roche Collaboration\n\nUnder the terms of the license agreement, Roche made a cash upfront payment and will provide research funding to Icagen. In addition, Icagen is eligible to potentially receive development and commercial milestone payments of up to $274 million and royalty payments should a drug be commercialized from any of the collaboration's programs.\n\nIcagen will be responsible for most preclinical activities up to lead optimization with both Icagen and Roche applying resources to identify candidates for entry into IND-enabling studies.

The increasing cases of comorbid diseases in aged population are increasing the patient pool taking admission in intensive care units and critical care units. This in turn is boosting the market. An article by a medical journal, called 'Annals of Intensive Care' has stated that, aged people comprise nearly 10% to 20% of all ICU admissions in Europe. Another article published in 2015 by the Journal of Hospital Administration states the percentage of aged people taking admission in critical care units in Australia has increased from 8.6% to 14.5%. The aforementioned factors indicate that the increasing number of geriatric population is a major factor propelling growth of the sedation in ICU setting market in the future.\n\nInvestment towards improvement of healthcare facilities and introduction of innovation such as better ventilation, better drainage systems, larger space for allowing more visiting members, and others are creating growth opportunities for the global sedation in ICU setting market. Additionally, the rise in disposable income of people have encouraged them to opt for better medical assistance and facilities for their near and dear ones. This will also help the market witness growth in the coming years.\n\nDetailed Table of Content:\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1. Research Scope\n\n1.2. Market Segmentation\n\n1.3.

At the same time, many delegations stressed that, given the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, any date set would be considered a \"working hypothesis\" and that an ongoing evaluation and review would be needed as circumstances become clearer.\n\nAmb. Walker said he would continue consulting with members on setting a precise date for MC12.\n\nMC12 was originally scheduled to take place in the Kazakh capital Nur-Sultan on 8-11 June 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Kazakhstan informed WTO members in late April that it remained ready to host MC12 in June 2021 in Nur-Sultan and asked the General Council chair to consult with WTO members on its proposal.\n\nAmb. Walker said that a formal decision about the new date for MC12 will need to be taken by the General Council and that he would aim to continue to consult with a view to setting a precise date for MC12 at the General Council's next meeting in July.\n\nWTO members also discussed the timetable proposed by the General Council chair for the appointment of the next WTO Director-General. On 14 May, Director-General Roberto Azev\u00eado informed members that he intended to step down on 31 August 2020, a year before his term was to have expired.\n\nUnder the process set out by the chair, nominations for the post will be accepted from 8 June until 8 July 2020. After that, the candidates will have a period of time to make themselves known to members, including a special General Council meeting where the candidates will be invited to make presentations, followed by the consensus-building phase devoted to selecting and appointing one of the candidates.\n\nAmb. Walker said that he will be consulting with members in order to establish expedited deadlines for the post-nomination phases so that members may have clarity on the timeline for the appointment process by the end of the nomination period. Both candidates and the membership needed to know the expected timelines for the entire process, he added.\n\nFurther information on the process is available here.\n\nIn his role as chair of the Trade Negotiations Committee, DG Azev\u00eado reported to members on the ongoing efforts of the chairs of the negotiations on fisheries subsidies, agriculture, and special and differential treatment to explore options for allowing dialogue to continue.\n\nDG Azev\u00eado also reported on his own recent activities. In addition to two prior reports to members on trade and COVID-19, he participated in a virtual meeting of the UN Chief Executives Board as well as a discussion hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel with the heads of four other international organizations, where the economic and social impacts of the pandemic featured prominently.\n\nHe also participated in a Trade Dialogues event at the request of the International Chamber of Commerce and B20 Saudi Arabia.\n\n\" Ensuring that businesses and households have the confidence to invest and consume will be a very important part of our economic recovery,\" DG Azev\u00eado told members. \" And it is why the multilateral trading system has an important role to play in all of these efforts.\"\n\n\" All members must intensify efforts to do what they can - at home, and collectively - to foster a strong rebound. In our activities here at the WTO - on monitoring and transparency, implementation of commitments, negotiations and broader reform efforts - we must work to ensure that our organization emerges out of this crisis more resilient than ever, and even more responsive to members' changing needs.\"\n\nWTO members also discussed a statement issued by trade ministers from Australia, Canada, Korea, New Zealand and Singapore on 1 May regarding action plans to facilitate the flow of goods and services as well as the essential movement of people. The ministers pledged to identify concrete actions that could help alleviate the impact of COVID-19 and work with other countries to develop these actions.\n\nMembers also reviewed a report from the chair of the dedicated session of the Committee on Trade and Development regarding the work programme on small economies and received updates from the General Council chair on implementation of the outcomes from the WTO's 2013 Bali, 2015 Nairobi and 2017 Buenos Aires Ministerial Conferences.\n\nUnder other business, Amb.

And for longtime shareholders, CRM stock has been one of the biggest winners.\n\nLed by forward-thinking and acquisition-happy founder and CEO Marc Benioff, CRM stock has rocketed from under $4 a share in 2004, to all-time highs around $195 a share earlier this year.\n\nThe company just released earnings, and while not every analyst loved them, the numbers weren't disappointing enough to suggest the long-term tailwinds at the company's back are changing. In fact, some of the numbers were pretty good.\n\nIf all you did was look at CRM stock immediately after fiscal first quarter 2021 results, you'd think its recent numbers just weren't very good. Shares fell about 4% following the results.\n\nHowever, let's get one thing clear: Salesforce's last quarter was good: the company beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. Revenue rose 30% year-over-year to $4.87 billion, better than the $4.85 billion consensus, and adjusted earnings per share clocked in at 70 cents, better than Wall Street's expectation for 69 cents per share.\n\nThat said, Salesforce stock didn't fall for no reason. Wall Street took issue with the company's second-quarter guidance, which called for revenue between $4.89 billion and $4.93 billion, below the $5.04 billion consensus. Analysts also didn't see their second-quarter EPS estimate of 74 cents matched by the software giant's guidance, which called for EPS between 66 cents and 67 cents.\n\nDoes guidance matter? Yes. But at the end of the day it's just a bunch of numbers in the air. It's the long-term earnings potential, growth potential, and staying power of any business that matters to Salesforce stock investors.\n\nBy that measure, it's been nothing but good news filtering in for the cloud-based customer relationship software company. The same day CRM announced first-quarter earnings, Benioff announced what he called \"one of the largest transactions we've ever done\": a deal with AT&T (NYSE:T) that will allow the wireless giant to compile customer data into one place and access it from multiple touchpoints.\n\nAnother partnership between Salesforce and enterprise cloud software company Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) further shows that Salesforce has simply become an absolutely vital part of a space that isn't going away anytime soon. If you've got customers -- especially if you've got a lot of them -- Salesforce can make your life easier, strengthen your customer relationships, and optimize your interactions with them.\n\nWorkday will integrate more deeply into Salesforce's Work.com, an incredibly relevant new suite of technologies focused on helping businesses re-open from the coronavirus-induced shutdown.\n\nShort-term gyrations in the wake of earnings reports are par for the course. What's not par for the course is a $150 billion growth stock like CRM, which has compounded revenue growth above 25% in the past five years and which is expected to continue posting 20% growth for the next five.\n\nBetting against Benioff has never been wise in the past, and with Salesforce firing on all cylinders in an economy facing record-setting unemployment claims and unpredictable business closures, it'll be a pleasure to watch what happens when the economy gets back on track.", "uri": "6085327204", "url": "https://investorplace.com/2020/05/crm-stock-still-a-buy-as-its-software-gains-influence/"}], "6085327641": [454838169, {"sentiment": 0.2, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:32:00Z", "name": "NY Governor Andrew Cuomo Requires Businesses To Deny Shoppers Without ", "dtype": "news", "pk": 454838169, "text": "Source: Spencer Platt / Getty\n\nIt seems that New York City might be on the brink of reopening within the coming weeks.

It eclipsed the previous all-time decrease of 6.9% in March.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would plummet 12.6% in April.

Spending on food and beverages fell in April.\n\nWELFARE ECONOMY\n\nBut the COVID-19 crisis boosted incomes for consumers in April, with the government transferring an additional $3 trillion (2.4 trillion pounds) to households. It doled out one-time $1,200 checks to millions of people and boosted unemployment benefits for the roughly 31 million out of work to cushion against economic hardship wrought by the pandemic.\n\nPersonal income surged a record 10.5% last month. Without the government money, income would have declined 6.3% with business closures pushing wages down 8.0%. The unprecedented economic upheaval saw the saving rate hitting a record 33%.\n\n\"If the economy reopens quickly without consequence, the millions who lost jobs are hired back and have no reason to fear they will lose their jobs again, these savings represent considerable spending power in the second half,\" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN in New York.\n\n\"If it takes longer to reopen the economy, these savings will be used for sustenance over the next few months. They will limit the decline, but not fuel a sharp rebound.\"\n\nThe economy is gradually reopening after nonessential businesses were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, raising hope the economic slump was bottoming. A survey on Friday showed consumer sentiment stable in May.\n\nStocks on Wall Street fell as investors braced for a U.S. response to China's national security law on Hong Kong. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.\n\nIn a second report on Friday, the Commerce Department said goods exports tumbled 25.2% to $95.4 billion in April, a 10-year low. The broad decline in exports was led by a 65.9% collapse in shipments of motor vehicles and parts. That outpaced a 14.3% tumble in imports. As a result, the goods trade deficit widened 7.2% to 69.7 billion last month.\n\nThe larger goods trade deficit is likely a drag on second GDP, which economists expect could drop at as much as a 40% rate, a pace not seen since the 1930s.\n\nThe economy contracted at a 5.0% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest pace of decline in GDP since the 2007-09 recession. Consumer spending tumbled at a 6.8% rate, the sharpest drop since the second quarter of 1980.\n\nWith consumer spending depressed in April, inflation pressures were weak. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components fell 0.4%. That was the largest drop since September 2001 and followed an unchanged reading in March.\n\nIn the 12 months through April, the so-called core PCE price index rose 1.0%, the smallest gain since December 2010 which followed a 1.7% increase in March. The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. The U.S. central bank has a 2% inflation target.\n\n\"The core PCE decline reflects some big collapses in the prices of a limited number of the most-affected services,\" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. \"It is not evidence of a widespread Japanese-style deflation ensnaring America.\"", "uri": "6085327590", "url": "https://uk.investing.com/news/economy/us-consumer-spending-tanks-savings-hit-record-high-2130161"}], "6085327571": [843621002, {"sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "published_on": "2020-05-29T15:48:00Z", "name": "Watch again: Rishi Sunak holds latest Covid-19 briefing - The Global Herald", "dtype": "news", "pk": 843621002, "text": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak outlines plans to taper furlough scheme\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak set out plans for the jobs retention scheme to begin tapering from August, with employers expected to contribute 20 per cent of their staff's salaries.\n\nHe appeared alongside Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, at the daily Downing Street briefing.\n\nThis morning, Environment Secretary George Eustice admitted that hospitality and other shuttered sectors would find this the \"greatest challenge\".\n\nFor all the latest politics news, head to our live blog: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/29/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-uk-update-news-latest/?WT.mc_id=tmg_youtube_offsite_televideo-youtubevideo_29MayBlog&utm_source=tmgoff&utm_medium=tmg_youtube&utm_content=offsite_televideo&utm_campaign=tmg_youtube_offsite_televideo-youtubevideo_29MayBlog\n\nGet the latest headlines: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\nTelegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.", "uri": "6085327571", "url": "https://theglobalherald.com/watch-again-rishi-sunak-holds-latest-covid-19-briefing/497712/"}], "6085327507": [651742612, {"sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:03:00Z", "name": "Nordstrom Sees Flexible Model Helping Manage COVID-19 Fallout", "dtype": "news", "pk": 651742612, "text": "Nordstrom's sales tumbled 40 percent during its first quarter, but officials said aggressive steps to reduce inventory and preserve cash will help the retailer in the near term while an accelerated expansion of its online and off-price business will better position the company for the long term.\n\n\"As retail continues to evolve, our flexible model supports a continued shift from what was predominantly a mall-based business toward a more diversified model that includes digital and off-price,\" said Erik Nordstrom, CEO, on a conference call with analysts.\n\nThe coronavirus forced Neiman Marcus, J.C. Penney and Stage Stores to file for bankruptcy protection with the department store in recent years struggling to adapt to the shift to online selling and facing lower traffic to malls and shrinking apparel sales.\n\nIn the quarter ended May 2, the net loss came to $521 million, which included after-tax asset impairment charges of $173 million for store closures, premium pay and benefits and restructuring-related to COVID-19.\n\nNordstrom recently announced plans to permanently close 16 of its 116 full-scale department stores as well as three Jeffrey specialty boutiques. Nordstrom said most of the impacted stores are in markets that have multiple full-line stores and are more than 20 years old. The Trunk Club business is also being integrated into the Nordstrom styling offering across stores and online. The charges in the quarter were only slightly offset by credits from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\n\nThe loss in the quarter compares to earnings of $37 million, or 33 cents a share, a year ago.\n\nRevenues Drop 36 Percent At Full-Price Stores And 45 Percent At Nordstrom Rack\n\nNet sales in the quarter were down 39.5 percent to $2.03 billion.\n\nIn Full-Price stores, sales decreased 36 percent while Off-Price sales from the Nordstrom Rack chain decreased 45 percent. The declines were due to temporary store closures beginning March 17. Full-Price results benefited from having a more established e-commerce business, including store fulfillment capabilities, which was enabled in Rack stores late in the quarter.\n\nSaid Nordstrom to analysts, \"Prior to the closures, we saw strong momentum from the second half of 2019 continue into February with positive sales growth. These closures had a meaningful impact on our financial results as stores made up two-thirds of sales in 2019.\n\nOnline demand, which reflects customer orders and therefore removes the timing impacts of shipments and returns, grew 9 percent, consistent with the second half of 2019. Total digital sales grew 5 percent to $1.1 billion in the first quarter. While stores were temporarily closed, e-commerce experienced significant growth in new customers of more than 50 percent.\n\nAnne Bramman, CFO, said that as the pandemic began impacting consumer behavior, the retailer leveraged its marketing and promotional capabilities to stimulate sales and appeal to customer interests, including a series of targeted promotions to clear seasonal inventory. She said, \"Our digital experience highlighted relevant categories such as wellness and comfort, which contributed to top-performing divisions in home, sleepwear and active. As we anticipated, our softest divisions were men's apparel, dresses and designer apparel.\"\n\nGross margins were reduced to 11 percent of sales from 34 percent for the same period in fiscal 2019 due to incremental markdowns to clear excess inventory and deleverage from lower sales volume.\n\nInventory Reduced 26 percent\n\nOn the positive side, inventory at the quarter's end decreased 26 percent year-over-year resulting from the company's aggressive action to reduce receipts and clear excess inventory through increased marketing and promotional activities.\n\nThe inventory reduction resulted from efforts during the quarter to decrease receipts by approximately 30 percent, stimulate demand through increased marketing and promotions and utilize store fulfillment capabilities. At Nordstrom Rack, receipts were canceled beginning in March through the second quarter allowing the chain to take advantage of closeouts in the marketplace this fall. Additionally, the Off-Price business, which makes up a third of sales, can help clear excess Full-Price inventory. This favorable inventory position enabled the company to bring in newness for customers beginning in June.\n\nSG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales, increased to 55 percent from 34 percent. Excluding charges related to COVID-19 of $250 million, total SG&A decreased approximately 25 percent from last year, primarily due to lower sales volume in addition to reduced overhead labor costs in response to the store closures.\n\nThe income tax benefit of $326 million, or 38 percent of the pretax loss, reflects a higher projected benefit rate for fiscal 2020 due to the carryback of net operating losses as permitted under the CARES Act.\n\nCash Burn Reduced More Than 40 Percent\n\nThe company entered the year with cash of approximately $850 million and increased its position to approximately $1.4 billion by the end of the first quarter. Its cash burn was reduced by over 40 percent as Nordstrom drew down and amended its $800 million revolver, issued $600 million in senior secured notes and suspended dividends and share repurchases. In addition to its planned expense savings of $200 million to $250 million, the company is on track to deliver further cash savings of more than $500 million in operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital in fiscal 2020. These savings include a reduction in non-occupancy overhead expenses of approximately 20 percent on an annualized basis.\n\n\"As we continue to navigate through this uncertainty, we're taking a cautious and thorough approach in planning our business,'' Bramman said, adding she hopes all stores reopen by the end of June, including in California, within a couple of weeks, then New York. \"Our scenario plans and stress testing contemplate a slow recovery and a continued promotional environment.''\n\nOmnichannel Strategy Accelerated\n\nNordstrom said its \"market strategy\" that enables customers to shop seamlessly across multiple touchpoints, including its two brands Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, in stores and online provides the flexibility to adjust to changes at retail that have been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"We see tremendous synergies from this model,\" said the CEO. \"When customers shop across more than one of these touchpoints, their spend increases 4-to-11 times on average. Additionally, our off-price business continues to be our greatest source of new customers, and nearly 30 percent of off-price customers cross-shop in Full-Price.\n\nHe noted that in 2019, off-price and e-commerce accounted for nearly 60 percent of sales while its U.S. mall-based/full-line stores accounted for 38 percent while contributing positive cash flows.\n\nThe retailer is forging ahead with plans to combine its Full-Price and Off-Price teams across regions to create a leaner and more flexible organization. The size of its corporate teams is also being reduced to increase agility. Technical investments include scaling its end-to-end platforms to support a single view of customers, inventory and product as well as integrating physical and digital capabilities in off-price.\n\nNordstrom told analysts that off-price is \"just a huge part of our future\" because of the way Nordstrom Rack complements its other businesses. He also noted that they're profitable, mostly in non-mall locations, and generally have shorter leases to support any need for relocation. Said Nordstrom, \"In these uncertain times going forward, our off-price stores give us a lot of flexibility.\"\n\nAsked about sales performance as stores have reopened, Nordstrom said, \"There are two trends. One, more outlying stores are performing a little better than more densely populated areas. I think that makes sense. The second part, our Off-Price, our Rack business, is outperforming expectations. Our Full-Price business is not in line with expectations.\"", "uri": "6085327507", "url": "https://sgbonline.com/nordstrom-sees-flexible-model-helping-manage-covid-19-fallout/"}], "6085327758": [795567338, {"sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:18:00Z", "name": "Soapie teasers: What's happening in 7de Laan in June 2020?", "dtype": "news", "pk": 795567338, "text": "Soapie Teasers provided by TVSA.

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the number of people with the disease is increasing in the coming years. In most cases, the predominant form of this cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, that because of side effects and high mortality rate, it is considered a major threat to public health.

(KOSDAQ:196170) has today presented at ASCO results from the First-in-Human (FIH), phase 1 study of ALT-P7, a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.\n\nThis is a FIH clinical trial of ALT-P7, a HER2-targeting ADC, and is a single-group, dose-escalation study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety of ALT-P7. For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the MTD of ALT-P7 was determined to be 4.5 mg/kg and was confirmed as the recommended dose for Phase II clinical trials (RP2D). Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who participated in this clinical trial had received 6 types of systemic chemotherapy, including 4 types of HER2-targeted therapy. In this trial, a total of 27 patients received study drug. The most common grade 3/4 adverse event (AE) was neutropenia. Other common treatment-related AEs of any grade were myalgia, fatigue, sensory neuropathy, alopecia, pruritus, and neutropenia. The dose limit toxicities (DLTs) were observed at 4.8 mg/kg with a single case of febrile neutropenia, hyperbilirubinemia, myalgia, and hyponatremia. The disease control rate (DCR) of ALT-P7 was 72%, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.2 months (95% CI: 2.5-9.9 months).\n\n\"Compared with other ADC therapeutics which have microtubule-targeting payloads, ALT-P7 exhibited substantial tolerability,\" said Dr. Jae Hyeon Juhn, director of Regulatory Affair and Clinical Development of Alteogen. \"The high tolerability together with a high disease control rate has the potential to offer a great benefit to patients, especially for those previously treated with several systemic & target therapeutics.\"\n\nBased on the RP2D determined in this trial, Alteogen plans to evaluate the efficacy of ALT-P7 with RP2D in Phase 2 and also will evaluate its applicability for other HER2-positive carcinomas such as urethral epithelial cell cancer, or biliary tract cancer as well.\n\nAbout Alteogen Inc.\n\nAlteogen Inc. is a Korea-based biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the development and commercialization of novel biologics.

President Trump has authorized USDA to ensure our patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers are supported and we are moving quickly to open applications to get payments out the door and into the pockets of farmers,\" said Secretary Perdue. \"These payments will help keep farmers afloat while market demand returns as our nation reopens and recovers. America's farmers are resilient and will get through this challenge just like they always do with faith, hard work, and determination.\"\n\nBeginning May 26, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, through the Farm Service Agency will be accepting applications from agricultural producers who have suffered losses.\n\nBackground:\n\nCFAP provides vital financial assistance to producers of agricultural commodities who have suffered a five-percent-or-greater price decline due to COVID-19 and face additional significant marketing costs as a result of lower demand, surplus production, and disruptions to shipping patterns and the orderly marketing of commodities.\n\nFarmers and ranchers will receive direct support, drawn from two possible funding sources. The first source of funding is $9.5 billion in appropriated funding provided in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Stability Act to compensate farmers for losses due to price declines that occurred between mid-January 2020, and mid-April 2020 and provides support for specialty crops for product that had been shipped from the farm between the same time period but subsequently spoiled due to loss of marketing channels. The second funding source uses the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to compensate producers for $6.5 billion in losses due to on-going market disruptions.\n\nNon-Specialty Crops and Wool\n\nNon-specialty crops eligible for CFAP payments include malting barley, canola, corn, upland cotton, millet, oats, soybeans, sorghum, sunflowers, durum wheat, and hard red spring wheat. Wool is also eligible. Producers will be paid based on inventory subject to price risk held as of January 15, 2020. A payment will be made based 50 percent of a producer's 2019 total production or the 2019 inventory as of January 15, 2020, whichever is smaller, multiplied by the commodity's applicable payment rates.\n\nLivestock\n\nLivestock eligible for CFAP include cattle, lambs, yearlings and hogs. The total payment will be calculated using the sum of the producer's number of livestock sold between January 15 and April 15, 2020, multiplied by the payment rates per head, and the highest inventory number of livestock between April 16 and May 14, 2020, multiplied by the payment rate per head.\n\nDairy\n\nFor dairy, the total payment will be calculated based on a producer's certification of milk production for the first quarter of calendar year 2020 multiplied by a national price decline during the same quarter. The second part of the payment is based a national adjustment to each producer's production in the first quarter.\n\nSpecialty Crops\n\nFor eligible specialty crops, the total payment will be based on the volume of production sold between January 15 and April 15, 2020; the volume of production shipped, but unpaid; and the number of acres for which harvested production did not leave the farm or mature product destroyed or not harvested during that same time period, and which have not and will not be sold. Specialty crops include, but are not limited to, almonds, beans, broccoli, sweet corn, lemons, iceberg lettuce, spinach, squash, strawberries and tomatoes. A full list of eligible crops can be found on farmers.gov/cfap. Additional crops may be deemed eligible at a later date.\n\nEligibility\n\nThere is a payment limitation of $250,000 per person or entity for all commodities combined. Applicants who are corporations, limited liability companies or limited partnerships may qualify for additional payment limits where members actively provide personal labor or personal management for the farming operation. Producers will also have to certify they meet the Adjusted Gross Income limitation of $900,000 unless at least 75 percent or more of their income is derived from farming, ranching or forestry-related activities. Producers must also be in compliance with Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation provisions.\n\nApplying for Assistance\n\nProducers can apply for assistance beginning May 26. Additional information and application forms can be found at farmers.gov/cfap. Producers of all eligible commodities will apply through their local FSA office. Documentation to support the producer's application and certification may be requested. FSA has streamlined the signup process to not require an acreage report at the time of application and a USDA farm number may not be immediately needed. Applications will be accepted through Aug. 28.\n\nPayment Structure\n\nTo ensure the availability of funding throughout the application period, producers will receive 80 percent of their maximum total payment upon approval of the application. The remaining portion of the payment, not to exceed the payment limit, will be paid at a later date as funds remain available.\n\nUSDA Service Centers are open for business by phone appointment only, and field work will continue with appropriate social distancing. While program delivery staff will continue to come into the office, they will be working with producers by phone and using online tools whenever possible. All Service Center visitors wishing to conduct business with the FSA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or any other Service Center agency are required to call their Service Center to schedule a phone appointment.

MLB on Tuesday proposed a series of tiered reductions that would cause top stars to receive the biggest cuts.\n\n\"Remember, games cannot be played without you,\" Boras wrote. \"Players should not agree to further pay cuts to bail out the owners. Let owners take some of their record revenues and profits from the past several years and pay you the prorated salaries you agreed to accept or let them borrow against the asset values they created from the use of those profits players generated.\"\n\nBoras is baseball's best-known agent and represented 71 players on active rosters and injured lists as of Aug. 31, the most among player representative firms. His Newport Beach, California-based company negotiated more than $1.2 billion in contracts during the offseason.\n\nSalaries were set to range from $563,500 for players at the major league minimum to $36 million for Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole, the latter a Boras client. Under the March agreement, the range would be cut to roughly $285,000 to $18 million for the 82-game regular season MLB has proposed. Under the economic proposal made by MLB this week, the range would be reduced to about $262,000 to $8 million, including shares of a bonus all players would receive if the postseason is played.\n\n\"Owners are asking for more salary cuts to bail them out of the investment decisions they have made,\" Boras said. \"If this was just about baseball, playing games would give the owners enough money to pay the players their full prorated salaries and run the baseball organization. The owners' current problem is a result of the money they borrowed when they purchased their franchises, renovated their stadiums or developed land around their ballparks. This type of financing is allowed and encouraged by MLB because it has resulted in significant franchise valuations.\"\n\n\"Owners now want players to take additional pay cuts to help them pay these loans. They want a bailout,\" he added. \"They are not offering players a share of the stadiums, ballpark villages or the club itself, even though salary reductions would help owners pay for these valuable franchise assets. These billionaires want the money for free. No bank would do that. Banks demand loans be repaid with interest. Players should be entitled to the same respect.\"\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred has said 40% of MLB's revenue is related to the gate. Teams told the union on May 12 that MLB would lose $640,000 for each game played in empty ballparks without fans. MLB claimed that playing with prorated salaries in empty ballparks would cause a $4 billion loss and give major league players 89% of revenue.\n\nWashington pitcher Max Scherzer, among three Boras clients on the union's eight-man executive subcommittee, issued a statement late Wednesday night saying \"there's no need to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions.\"\n\nBoras cited the purchase of the Chicago Cubs by the Ricketts family and the redevelopment of Wrigley Field. Debt financing was key to both, he said.\n\n\"Throughout this process, they will be able to claim that they never had any profits because those profits went to pay off their loans,\" he wrote. \"However, the end result is that the Ricketts will own improved assets that significantly increases the value of the Cubs -- value that is not shared with the players.\"\n\nThe Cubs said their financial decisions created revenue streams necessary for the payroll of the franchise, which in 2016 won its first title since 1908.\n\n\"The Ricketts family invested $750 million to save iconic Wrigley Field for fans today and for future generations,\" the team said in a statement. \"At every level they've built the best player facilities in the game. In 2019, the Cubs had one of the top baseball payrolls in the game. The fact of the matter is 70% of the team's revenues which support the baseball operations come from having fans in the ballpark. Nevertheless, we thank Mr. Boras for weighing in.\"\n\nBoras asked clients to \"please share this concept with your teammates and fellow players when MLB request further concessions or deferral of salaries.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake, owners have chosen to take on these loans because, in normal times, it is a smart financial decision,\" Boras wrote. \"But, these unnecessary choices have now put them in a challenging spot. Players should stand strong because players are not the ones who advised owners to borrow money to purchase their franchises and players are not the ones who have benefited from the recent record revenues and profits.\"\n\nHe added salaries have been flat for several years. The opening day average has been in the $4.4 million rang e since 2016.\n\nCincinnati pitcher Trevor Bauer addressed Boras on Wednesday on Twitter.\n\n\"Hearing a LOT of rumors about a certain player agent meddling in MLBPA affairs,\" Bauer tweeted. \"If true -- and at this point, these are only rumors -- I have one thing to say ... Scott Boras, rep your clients however you want to, but keep your damn personal agenda out of union business.\"", "uri": "6085326432", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/29/boras-to-clients-in-memo-dont-bail-out-baseball-owners/"}], "6085325248": [906524616, {"sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:22:00Z", "name": "Good Neighbors published May 29, 2020 | West Central Tribune", "dtype": "news", "pk": 906524616, "text": "WILLMAR -- The Kandiyohi County Food Shelf and Second Harvest Heartland will have a free food giveaway beginning at 10:30 a.m. Thursday, June 4, at the YMCA in Willmar.\n\nPre-packaged boxes of meat, dairy and produce will be distributed to anyone who needs it on a first-come, first-served basis until it is gone.\n\nEnter the YMCA parking lot from Olena Avenue Southeast.

This follows similar complaints by Tile in the United States.\n\nThe letter claims that Apple favors FindMy, the tech giant's own device tracking app, over Tile's in a few specific ways and asks for the European Commission to open a probe into Apple's business practices. Here's an excerpt from the letter by Tile general counsel Kirsten Daru, which was acquired by Financial Times:\n\nIn the past twelve months, Apple has taken several steps to completely disadvantage Tile, including by making it more difficult for consumers to use our products and services. This is particularly concerning because Apple's actions come at the same time that Apple both launched a new FindMy app that competes even more directly with Tile and also began preparing for the launch of a competitive hardware product.\n\nOne of Tile's key arguments is that Apple defaults the \"Always Allow\" flag to \"on\" for location-based tracking in the FindMy app when users set up their phones, but third-party apps that perform similar functions default to \"off.\" The result is that third-party apps must frequently show dialogues asking the user for permission until the user opts to manually turn on \"Always Allow\" for the app. This \"denigrates the user experience,\" according to Tile's letter.\n\nFurther ReadingAnd in a mirror of past complaints against Apple by other companies, Tile claimed that its app does not get \"equal placement\" with Apple's own apps in the App Store. Since those complaints first emerged, Apple has changed the results some users see when searching for certain types of apps, with the effect of increasing visibility of non-Apple apps in some cases. That said, Apple has not told app developers much about how its in-App Store search engine works.\n\nApple is already facing investigation in the European Union as a result of complaints by Spotify that, in addition to issues like App Store placement, Apple's 30-percent take from charges made within apps using Apple's own payment system is anti-competitive.\n\nResponding to Tile's allegations, Apple released the following statement:\n\nWe strenuously deny the allegations of uncompetitive behavior that Tile is waging against us. Consistent with the critical path we've been on for over a decade, last year we introduced further privacy protections that safeguard user location data. Tile doesn't like those decisions so instead of arguing the issue on its merits, they've instead decided to launch meritless attacks.\n\nApple has sought to make user privacy a key competitive advantage for its products through both privacy-oriented marketing and features in the software and even hardware of its devices. When users set up a new iPhone or iPad, Apple's own apps have default settings, but many of those settings must be confirmed one way or the other by the user before the device can be used. Third-party apps may ping users to request permission to do certain things when first launched, and users may go into a device's Settings app to manage permissions for specific third-party apps.\n\nFurther ReadingWhile the parts of Tile's complaint letter that are publicly available do not directly discuss privacy in any detail, the complaint could be a sort of Rorschach Test for onlookers: are Apple's privacy policies designed with the user's interest in mind, or are they a shield for anti-competitive business practices?\n\nThe case is partially hinged on the notion that Apple plans to introduce a hardware competitor to Tile's products. Apple has not publicly confirmed that, but there have been numerous reports from reliable sources that have said Apple is close to launching such a product for many months. Evidence of the product's existence has also been found by developers in Apple's recent software releases for iPhones and other devices.\n\nAccording to Financial Times, the European Commission has said that it received the letter and that it \"will reply in due course.\"", "uri": "6085326844", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/iphone-privacy-prompts-discriminate-against-non-apple-apps-complaint-says/"}], "6085326975": [404139947, {"sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:46:00Z", "name": "A Look Back at Kylie Jenner in Photos Through the Years", "dtype": "news", "pk": 404139947, "text": "Kylie Jenner may be the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, but she's certainly carved out her own path since October 2007, when Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered on E!.\n\nNo longer known simply as the daughter of Kris and Caitlyn Jenner or the little sister of Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9, Kim and Kendall; Kylie is a serious force to be reckoned with in her own right.\n\nIn March 2019, she became the world's youngest \"self-made billionaire\" thanks to her uber-successful business ventures in makeup, with Kylie Cosmetics, and fashion, with Kendall + Kylie.\n\nFurther cementing Kylie's place in history is her own spinoff series on E!, Life of Kylie, and her undeniable social media footprint.

He accompanied even Mr. Legault to the traditional press point 13 p.m. Thursday.\n\n\"It is normal to have fears. Especially in the context where it was. But the experience has been very positive,\" says Dr. Arruda, criticized for its possible lack of independence in the face of the policy decisions of d\u00e9confinement.\n\n\"There are achievements also in these experiments, there for back to school next year,\" he continues. It is even in the process of looking at how we could go further into the different approaches to school in the fall, that would allow both to avoid major outbreaks of disease. It is clear that there will be cases, as there have been a few. But everything is under control, then there is no horror story. And the teachers, children and parents are happy.\"\n\n\"We must not think himself too good\"\n\nQuebec was the first of the 10 canadian provinces and 50 american States to reopen its classes on may 11. Most jurisdictions do not will re-open no school before the end of the summer.\n\n\"When we decided to open the schools outside the metropolitan area, people said to us, \"But it has no good sense!\" Other provinces have said : \"It has no good sense!\" Then you can see what is happening today, this is not necessarily a tragedy,\" says Dr. Arruda.\n\n\"You know, I do not consider that I have the truth. The truth is somewhere between the two. [...] Each time, you can say : it was not too slow, it has perhaps been a little too fast. Up to now, the business go as we plan. But outside of Montreal, it is not fragile, but in Montreal, it is fragile.\"\n\nFor his part, the prime minister has still served a warning earlier in the conference, as a warning to himself. \"If we want to be able to continue the re-opening, it is necessary to follow the instructions. [...] He should not think himself too good, because the virus will take the opportunity to come back.\"\n\n74 new death\n\nAfter 10 weeks of balance sheets of 13: almost daily where he was always the number of new deaths associated with the COVID-19, Mr. Legault has left this week the ministry of Health and the national Institute of public health published the data of the day in the late morning.\n\nDeclaration of 74 more deaths in the previous 24 hours across the province of Quebec, therefore, to increase the count to 4302 since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nOf these 74, 70, were living in accommodation for the elderly, or accommodation facility of long-term care (CHSLDS), intermediate resource (IR) or a private seniors ' residence (RPA). In total, 85 % of Qu\u00e9bec deceased of the COVID-19 lived in these environments.\n\nTo this day, 2725 residents are infected within 340 of 2600 places. Just for NURSING homes, it is 1741 sick in 131 of 412 CHSLD.\n\nAfter reaching the hundred dead Wednesday, the region in the National Capital has crossed the mark of 1500 cases, Thursday, with 1501.\n\nIn the province as a whole, the number of hospitalizations continues to decline for a ninth day in a row. There are now 1331 patients treated for the COVID-19 in quebec hospitals, including 178 who were confined to bed in intensive care.\n\nMr. Legault continued his great seduction to attract 10 000 people to enroll in the new accelerated training paid attendant to the beneficiaries, which will begin mid-June.\n\n\"If you want to make a difference in the lives of the people agree-you!\" he launched to the viewers, offering them even read the last book, by Marie Laberge, Through the night, to find the inspiration and the beauty that can be taken on the job of attendant to the beneficiaries.\n\nA \"get involved!\", which reiterates the invitation to member of another place and time. Army that threatens precisely to withdraw its thousands of soldiers in the front in the CHSLD du Qu\u00e9bec. A vital aid that the prime minister does not want to lose before mid-September.\n\n\"Quebec pays its share to the army. I understand that there are other priorities, but it seems to me that the priority currently, I cannot think of anything more urgent than dealing with our world in our NURSING homes. Same thing in the centers of long-term care in Ontario. I understand that there may be a rhythm of work that should be reviewed. I saw that some soldiers work seven days a week, but they may be able to work five days per week. There are accommodations. I hope to be able to discuss with the federal government and the military\" wishes to Mr. Legault.\n\nTo DISCOVER : the detailed map of The Covid-19 prepared by Beno\u00eet Lalonde, head of practical work and research in the Department of geography, and St\u00e9fano Biondo, cartoth\u00e9caire at the Centre G\u00e9oStat of the Library, Universit\u00e9 Laval", "uri": "6085326668", "url": "https://koztimes.com/deconfinement-schools-a-great-success-welcomes-legault-video/10894/"}], "6085326982": [618668111, {"sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:46:00Z", "name": "Flight Crew: Distributor not Cavalier about its beers", "dtype": "news", "pk": 618668111, "text": "George Fisher had a vision when founding Cavalier Distributing in Cincinnati in 1992.\n\nHe saw a company that could provide customers with better beer and more selection.\n\nFrom selling and delivering beer in his 1986 Subaru hatchback to now covering three states, it was indeed a vision with merit.\n\nBy 1999, the business named after the mascot of Fisher's high school alma mater had expanded to cover all of Ohio.

An aroma of fresh lemon is readily noticed, yet it's not overpowering. This beer has much more of a natural, light, lemony flavor, compared to some others I've had. Summer is fast approaching. And, whether poolside, camping, cookouts or whatever your heart desires, you're going to need a bigger cooler. I don't consider myself a big shandy connoisseur by any means, but I've had my fair share. This one really seems to stand out for the sheer clean, natural crisp flavor it delivers. So, if you're looking to quench your thirst and want to pace the long summer days to come...pick up a few packs and crush away!\" -- Brian Long\n\nFAT HEAD'S STRANGE MAGIC IPA (6.5% ABV) \"I'm a fan of Fat Head's. And I love Jeff Lynne and the Electric Light Orchestra. ELO's version of 'Strange Magic' only hit #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1976. But, this awesome IPA from Fat Head's earned #1 in the King of Ohio best IPAs contest last year. As easy listening as ELO is, this beer is just as easy going down. In this day of wildly popular hazy IPAs, this one's extremely clear. You get a familiar dank aroma when you pop this one open, then the magical taste of bright, tropical hops on your palate. All the magic's in the combination of Warrior, Mosaic and Citra hops. The can says it's strange this beer's not all gone when it's time to can it. Agreed. If I were on the canning line, I'd sure want to be sipping the heck out of it. Get yourself a six-pack -- or more -- of this winner from Fat Head's and, as the can reads, 'Watch it Disappear.'\" -- Jim Cyphert\n\nEINSTOCK ICELANDIC WHITE ALE (5.2% ABV) \"Einstock Icelandic White Ale is actually brewed in Iceland, only 60 miles south of the Arctic Circle. It's brewed with coriander and orange peel and a touch of oats using pure Icelandic water. It pours with a straw-yellow hue and a nearly perfect white head. This is a really gentle brew that carries a very drinkable 5.2 percent ABV. The orange and coriander meet well, with neither being over the top. It's soft on the palate and very refreshing.\" -- Roger Gillespie\n\nJACKIE O's FLUID FORMS HAZY DOUBLE IPA (9.0% ABV) \"They should just rename the brewery to Jackie O My Goodness, because everything they put out seems to spark that feeling. This hazy double IPA is no exception. An Ohio grain bill paired with Citra, Sabro and Idaho 7 hops collaborates to make this beautiful hazy beer. At first glance and sniff, you're whisked away to a tropical island, as this citrusy colored ale with fluffy white head gives way to the aromas of tangerine, pineapple, mango and coconut. It's full flavored, but subtle in its showcase of each. Think tropical concoction on hops. It's well balanced with a soft, cloud-like mouthfeel that gives way to the lingering of citrus fruit on your palate. Definitely a beer to sit next to a pool with.\" -- Jason Jugenheimer\n\nNARRAGANSETT LAGER (5.0% ABV) \"You know you have a great beer if it's been brewed since 1890, and it's still one of the best-rated, according to Beer Advocate and Untapped. There's so much history behind this one. It was the first alcoholic beverage served at a professional sporting event -- at Boston Red Sox baseball games in 1944. Then, in the 1970s, it made its way to the big screen, when Captain Quint chugged one and crushed the can in Jaws. The beer pours a light golden color with a nice head. It's clean and crisp, which makes it a true American Lager.\" -- Joe Sanfilippo\n\nURBAN ARTIFACT THE GADGET (7.9% ABV) \"This isn't one of those 4th grade math problems, so don't overthink it. What do you get when you multiply 1,200 times 2? The unique recipe for The Gadget, as in Cincinnati-based Urban Artifact's Midwest fruit-tart sour beer. This devilish concoction gets its pucker power from the addition of 1,200 pounds of blackberries and 1,200 pounds of raspberries brewed into every batch. The artwork then reveals itself in both appearance and taste. It pours out a cloudy, dark-violet, ruby color with a medium white head, I found the taste to be medium bodied, and both tart and sweet, with raspberry being the more dominant funky flavor. It was easy to see why this is the brewery's flagship beer!\" -- Dave Shively\n\nRecommended Flight Pattern: Next time you're out picking up craft beer, keep an eye out for Cavalier Distributing's selection of \"better beers.\"", "uri": "6085326982", "url": "https://www.indeonline.com/news/20200527/flight-crew-distributor-not-cavalier-about-its-beers?rssfeed=true"}], "6085326430": [200159281, {"sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:10:00Z", "name": "TMZ: Former Mets Minor Leaguer Calls Tebow Signing 'A Mockery'", "dtype": "news", "pk": 200159281, "text": "An ex-Mets minor league player took a shot at his former organization's signing of Tim Tebow, calling it \"a mockery\" designed to \"sell more tickets.\"\n\nAndrew Church, a 2nd round pick of the Mets in 2013, was released this week along with dozens of other minor league players across baseball as the impact of the pandemic continues to ravage America's pastime.\n\nIn an Instagram post late Thursday night, Church vented about his frustrations with his club's parent organization.\n\n\"The Mets made a mockery of our team by putting a celebrity on it to sell more tickets,'' Church wrote. \"I saw players lose their jobs because of it.\n\n\"We weren't playing to win, we were playing to make everyone else money.

(Nasdaq: GOSS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing therapeutics in the disease areas of immunology, inflammation and oncology, today announced the presentation of positive safety and biomarker data at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program (ASCO20) from its ongoing Phase 1/2 study of GB1275 in patients with selected solid tumors.\n\nThe KEYNOTE-A36 Phase 1/2 study is currently undergoing dose escalation of GB1275 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab). As of the March 27, 2020 data cutoff, 22 patients had been enrolled in the study. GB1275 has been well tolerated to date, both as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA. No dose-limiting toxicities have been reported, and dose escalation in both arms continues. Dose-dependent increases in GB1275 plasma concentration have been observed, and the 7-hour elimination half-life of GB1275 supports BID, or twice-daily, dosing.\n\nConsistent with the proposed mechanism of GB1275, decreases in both peripheral monocytic and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, were observed following treatment with GB1275. Preliminary analyses also showed dose-dependent differences in peripheral gene expression profiles and unique transcriptomic expression patterns in patients treated with GB1275 monotherapy or combination with KEYTRUDA.\n\nEarly signs of activity were observed in a patient with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), who had previously experienced disease progression after more than ten lines of therapy, including treatment with atezolizumab, an anti-PDL1 antibody. The patient, enrolled in the lowest dosage cohort of the combination arm, experienced greater than 50% decreases in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), both of which were sustained after four cycles of therapy. This patient was the only mCRPC patient enrolled at the time of data cutoff and remains on study treatment.\n\n\"We are encouraged by the early signs of biologic and clinical activity observed as we have been able to safely dose escalate the GB1275 monotherapy and KEYTRUDA combination therapy regimens,\" said Sheila Gujrathi, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Gossamer. \"We hope to build on these promising signals from our initial dose escalation cohorts as the study continues.\"\n\n\"Despite the advent of checkpoint immunotherapies, a high unmet medical need remains for the vast majority of patients with advanced solid tumors,\" said Drew Rasco, M.D., of the START Cancer Center in San Antonio, TX, a principal investigator of the study who also provided a five-minute audio commentary that accompanies the poster on the ASCO20 website. \"The preliminary biomarker analyses presented at ASCO20 show GB1275 is having an impact on the immunosuppressive cells which often lead to primary or secondary resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy. I am excited to continue studying GB1275 in the clinic and look forward to future data readouts.\"\n\nThe poster can be viewed in the \"Posters and Presentations\" section of the Gossamer Bio website (https://www.gossamerbio.com/pipeline/posters-and-publications/). The poster and a 5-minute audio commentary presented by Dr. Rasco are available on demand on the ASCO20 website.

GB1275 is designed to modulate the activity of immunosuppressive cell types, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MDSCs, by decreasing the trafficking of these cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and re-polarizing those cells in the TME to an active state. The KEYNOTE-A36 Phase 1/2 trial is enrolling patients with selected solid tumor indications. The study is currently enrolling dose escalation cohorts of GB1275 monotherapy and combination therapy with KEYTRUDA and will also include dose escalation of GB1275 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Merck (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) has agreed to supply KEYTRUDA for the KEYNOTE-A36 trial. KEYTRUDA\u00ae is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA. Gossamer retains worldwide rights to GB1275.\n\nAbout Gossamer Bio\n\nGossamer Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, acquiring, developing and commercializing therapeutics in the disease areas of immunology, inflammation and oncology.

The project involves digging the ground, removing soil, and setting up shrimp hatcheries, which will deface the protected natural reserve.\"\n\nInitially added to the coveted network in 2006, Qeshm Geopark was dropped from the Global Geoparks Network (GGN) in 2013 due to the authorities' failure to address the site's problems, such as underdeveloped infrastructure and unenforced environmental regulations.\n\nAfter years of back and forth and discussions with UNESCO experts, Iranian authorities submitted the geopark's dossier for review last year and it received the provisional approval during the Seventh International Conference on UNESCO's Global Geoparks Network in Torquay, England.\n\nIn 2017, the geopark managed to reclaim its global status, after 10 days of deliberation by UNESCO's Executive Board in Paris. Seven other geological sites were also added to the list, according to a press release on GGN's website.\n\nUNESCO announced that the Qeshm Geopark will be a UNESCO site until 2020 when its members will be reviewed.\n\nDescribing Qeshm as \"an island shaped like a dolphin in the Strait of Hormuz, off the southern coast of Iran\", the press release on GGN's website points to the island's geological formations that have been shaped by erosion that created \"a range of spectacular landscapes and beautiful rock deserts\".\n\nOne of Iran's seven free zones, Qeshm Island is a top holiday destination and a treasure trove of natural and ecological attractions in the Persian Gulf. The island is a heaven for eco-tourists as it embraces wide-ranging attractions such as the Hara marine forests and about 60 villages dotted mostly across its rocky coastlines.\n\nAside from the geopark, sun and sandy beaches, the island's famed mangrove forests in the Hara Protected Area attract a large number of domestic and foreign tourists. Hara Protected Area is one of the five forests in Hormozgan Province and arguably the most important feature of Qeshm Geopark. With an area of 85,686 hectares, Hara is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

I think we put the right ingredients together to make this successful.\"\n\nTypically, accelerator participants will work through issues in person in small groups and they will serve as sounding boards for each other.

The days that followed showed a country struggling economically and marred with social-economic challenges faced by the thousands of Nairobi residents who were left jobless. \"We hold the view that safety remains a priority and also appreciate the fact that life has to go on; people to have an opportunity to have a daily meal income and at the very least be facilitated to meet basic daily necessities,\" read the statement by KNCCI.Even though the ban of movement in and out of Nairobi's attempted to bar people from streaming into the capital, movement within the city has been as usual even though the government gave directives that people should try to stay at home. For this reason, the attempt of containing the spread of Covid-19 and flattening the curve has been a futile effort even as the country records 127 new cases as of May 29.The private sector hopes to salvage the economic sector even as the entire fabric of our society continue capsizing in the brutal storm of Covid-19. According to KNCCI, the economy should be opened to be able to serve 83.6 per cent of Kenyans employed in the informal sector and who risk suffering from hunger if nothing is done. \"The curfew and cessation of movement rules are temporary stop-gap measures to address the situation. We should now be alive to the fact that what the new normal should be and abide by all the health guidelines and protocols advised by the government,\" read the statement.The private sector has also appealed to the president to not only lift the ban on movement out of counties like Mombasa, Kwale and Nairobi but also the curfew time from 7pm to 5 am.\"If total lifting of the curfew and ban on movement is not tenable, we passionately appeal to his Excellency to extend the curfew hours from 7pm to 10pm,\" read the statement. The economic predicament that is being experienced all over the world comes at a time when President John Pombe Magufuli has remained adamant in ensuring that the economy of Tanzania does not suffer at the hands of the pandemic. Magufuli has maintained business as usual without putting in place the extreme measures of lockdowns for his people.Kenya seats at a table behind other countries such as the United States, Germany and Italy which have recently started to partially reopen their economy after several weeks under lockdown.If the number of people racing out to the Nairobi central business district every day is everything to go by, the coronavirus won't stop individuals from finding their daily wages.", "uri": "6085324569", "url": "https://kenyandigest.com/private-sector-asks-president-uhuru-to-re-open-economy/"}], "6085325715": [361162050, {"sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:45:00Z", "name": "Businesses deserve a break from legislative onslaughts", "dtype": "news", "pk": 361162050, "text": "During a hearing soon after the state Legislature returned from its COVID-19-related hiatus, an Assembly committee considered a measure that would have imposed criminal penalties on online hotel booking sites that don't disclose all of their fees.\n\nBy California standards, Assembly Bill 3235 was a relatively modest regulation - and it failed to secure enough votes for passage.

With that confirmation, Sony Interactive Entertainment President and CEO Jim Ryan says the company wants to give players games \"that can really only be enjoyed on thePS5.\"\n\nThe quote came via an interview with GamesIndustry.biz, where Ryan says that next-gen consoles \"should include features and benefits that the previous generation does not include.\" Microsoft's strategy is inherently limiting as it tries to include the Xbox One within its family of console moving forward, which presents a \"lowest common denominator\" that games must meet. If it's also possible on this generation of console, then what's the point of next-gen except faster load times and prettier images?\n\n\"We have always said that we believe in generations,\" Ryan said. \"We believe that when you go to all the trouble of creating a next-gen console, that it should include features and benefits that the previous generation does not include. And that, in our view, people should make games that can make the most of those features.\n\n\"We do believe in generations, and whether it's the DualSense controller, whether it's the 3D audio, whether it's the multiple ways that the SSD can be used... we are thinking that it is time to give the PlayStation community something new, something different, that can really only be enjoyed on PS5.\"\n\nThis seems to be a direct response to the Inside Xbox showcase, which failed to show anything truly compelling and \"next-gen,\" rather offering a vast majority of games that are cross-gen experiences.\n\nBut while Sony will create experiences exclusively for the PS5, Ryan acknowledges that the massive install base of the PS4 shouldn't be entirely left behind. \"We have always felt that we had a responsibility to serve that [PS4] community for several years after the launch of PS5 and that it represented a huge business opportunity for us,\" Ryan said. \"The numbers are quite straightforward. If you say in broad-brush figures that we have a community of 100 million PS4 owners right now, and in the first couple of years... I don't know, somewhere between 15 and 25 million might migrate to PS5, that still leaves a huge number of people with PS4s.\"\n\nBut don't worry, even if you do move up to the PS5, all PS4 games submitted for certification after July will be required to also work on the PS5. In a way, Sony's policies are opposite Microsoft's. There will be unique experiences only available on PS5 hardware, but by upgrading, you aren't leaving behind games still being made for the PS4, which makes a compelling argument to move to the next-gen PlayStation console.\n\nSony has committed to a June 4th date for the PS5 reveal event, or at least a PS5 games showcase to demonstrate what's possible on the PlayStation 5 console. With these comments in mind, expect Sony to focus on specific aspects and features only possible via new hardware.", "uri": "6085325056", "url": "https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2020/05/29/ps5-games-playable-ps4-ps5-features/"}], "6085323442": [963941129, {"sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:37:00Z", "name": "No Dining, No Wine-ing: Napa Winery Sues California Over 'Unfair' Reopening Rules", "dtype": "news", "pk": 963941129, "text": "While wineries across California can reopen if they offer dine-in meals to guests, a 1990 ordinance bars Napa County wineries from selling food in tasting rooms. Now one prestigious vintner has sued the state claiming unfair treatment.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (CN) -- California's reopening measures in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic have placed unfair restrictions on numerous wineries in the state, according to a federal lawsuit by one of Napa Valley's most prestigious vintners.\n\nThe complaint, filed Thursday in the Northern District of California by Caymus Vineyards, names Governor Gavin Newsom and state Public Health Officer Sonia Angell. According to the complaint, the family-run Caymus is \"one of the most celebrated winemakers in California\" and a leader in the state's $40 billion wine industry, best known for its \"special selection\" cabernet sauvignon, \"the only wine ever honored twice as Wine Spectator's 'Wine of the Year.'\"\n\nThe winemaker says California, as part of its efforts to reopen the state in a series of phases, has adopted reopening guidelines that are unfair to some wineries in the state.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, California is currently in stage two of its reopening plan. Under this phase, several businesses are allowed to open their doors to the public once more including clothing stores, bookstores and even some barber shops and hair salons in certain areas.\n\nIncluded in these new reopening guidelines is an expanded scope of restaurants that can reopen, with many California restaurants now able to offer traditional dine-in experiences.\n\nBut Caymus claims the same allowance has not been equally extended to some California wineries. The winemaker claims California has issued an arbitrary order that wineries and establishments like them must remain closed if they do not offer sit-down dining, that winery should remain closed.\n\nCaymus says the order's language on this subject is quite clear.\n\n\"Brewpubs, breweries, bars, pubs, craft distilleries, and wineries should remain closed until those establishments are allowed to resume modified or full operation unless they are offering sit-down, dine-in meals. Alcohol can only be sold in the same transaction as a meal,\" the May 12 order states, according to the complaint.\n\nCaymus says this restriction means many wineries are being treated unequally compared to other business establishments and restaurants.\n\nThe winery says this is particularly unfair given that many wineries cannot legally offer meals even if they wanted to. Under the 1990 Winery Definition Ordinance, all Napa wineries are barred from offering any kind of food service. That leaves Caymus and other Napa wineries with no option but to remain shuttered.\n\nCalifornia officials have a duty to enforce and carry out these reopening orders in a way that similar businesses are treated with similar fairness -- a duty that has not been satisfied in this instance, Caymus says.\n\n\"As applied to Caymus, and over 400 other wineries with facilities in Napa County, the governor's and state public health officer's orders fail to do so,\" the winery says in its complaint. \"Run-of-the-mill retailers like toy stores may reopen. Restaurants offering indoor food service may reopen. Wineries that provide \"sit-down, dine-in meals\" may reopen. But wineries dedicated to wine tasting, like Caymus, may not.\"\n\nCaymus claims this treatment is unsupported for several reasons. The winery notes other states such as North Carolina and Oregon have already taken steps to reopen wineries and tasting rooms that are adhering to the same health guidelines as restaurants.\n\nThe winery also claims that businesses like it are actually well equipped to practice proper social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most wineries have outdoor spaces where it is easier to keep people apart, their products come largely prepackaged and many wineries operate on a reservation system to keep crowd sizes to a minimum.\n\nThese are natural advantages that a winery has at its disposal during a health crisis, Caymus claims, and there is no sound reason why they should not be able to exercise those advantages at this time.\n\nThe winery also makes clear it is not attempting to back away from the state's Covid-19 health guidelines. Caymus says it is supportive of the guidelines -- and would like the opportunity to practice them.\n\n\"Caymus does not seek to insulate itself or its fellow wineries from the state's general public health guidelines,\" the winery says in its complaint. \"To the contrary, Caymus supports those guidelines and seeks to incorporate them into its business. Defendants cannot offer a good reason for failing to trust wineries to follow health guidelines in their indoor and outdoor tasting areas, even while they trust toy stores, restaurants, and florists to do the same.\"\n\nCaymus wants the court to bar California from excluding tasting rooms and outdoor tasting areas at Caymus and other wineries from its reopening orders.\n\nThomas Harvey, Caymus' attorney, says the case is ultimately about equal treatment.\n\n\"Caymus supports the state's effort to keep Californians safe,\" Harvey said in an email. \"But as California reopens, Caymus should be treated the same as similar businesses. Restaurants, retail and wineries that offer dine-in meals are permitted to reopen. The current order punishes Caymus and other Napa wineries because -- unlike neighboring wineries in Sonoma -- they are not allowed to offer dine-in meals. There's no rational basis for that distinction. If anything, the health order has it backwards.\"\n\nHarvey said the issue is simple and one that can be easily repaired.\n\n\"This is a common-sense issue, one that the state can resolve easily by revising the Phase 2 order to include all wineries,\" Harvey said.\n\nRepresentatives for the California officials named as defendants did not immediately respond to request for comment by press time.", "uri": "6085323442", "url": "http://www.courthousenews.com/no-dining-no-wine-ing-napa-winery-sues-california-over-unfair-reopening-rules/"}], "6085325432": [541839162, {"sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "published_on": "2020-05-29T17:45:00Z", "name": "Club news", "dtype": "news", "pk": 541839162, "text": "Crest Area for LIFE met 7 p.m. May 26 at the Holy Spirit Hall.

But those virtues and their recent strength meant little as they were swept up in the dash for dollars that began as February ended.\n\nBonds from fiscally healthy places such as Utah and Georgia fared better than those from states such as Illinois, New Jersey, and Kentucky, which face significant fiscal challenges. But nearly every corner of the muni market suffered an abrupt shock, and issuance of new bonds ground to a halt as buyers disappeared.\n\nEven in the best of times, the $3.9 trillion muni market is less liquid than other fixed income markets. The selloff threatened not only to raise borrowing costs for states and cities but also to potentially put their ability to borrow in question even as tax revenues dried up along with business activity and consumer spending.\n\nTo backstop states and other municipal issuers, the Federal Reserve announced on April 9 that it will buy up to $500 billion of muni bonds from states, counties with populations of at least 2 million residents, and cities with at least one million residents. Only 10 cities and 16 counties nationwide are big enough to qualify, but states may use the proceeds from purchases by the Fed to support counties and cities as well.\n\nEarlier, on March 20, the Fed had previously announced that it would expand its purchases of municipal bonds to include those with maturities inside of one year. A few days later, on March 27, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act which authorized the Fed to buy municipal bonds of any maturity. The CARES Act also appropriated $274 billion to muni issuers, including state and local governments, health care systems, transit systems, and educational institutions.\n\nMunicipal budgets still face significant challenges due to lower tax revenues that result from widespread shutdowns of businesses. But Fidelity's government relations office says the passage of the fixed income market support provisions in the CARES Act are helping to stabilize the operations of the fixed income marketplace, and sees the liquidity facilities announced by the Fed on April 9 as a net positive for the municipal fixed income market.\n\nPaul Maguire, Institutional Portfolio Manager with Fidelity's fixed income division, says that liquidity in the muni market has improved significantly, primarily because of the monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the federal government in the past few weeks. \"The Fed has done a great job of identifying the liquidity bottlenecks in the market and of being proactive in addressing them. Still, while pockets of liquidity now exist, challenges remain.\"\n\nMaguire says the federal government's combination of public policy initiatives has gone a long way toward improving the liquidity of the municipal bond market and returning it to some state of normalcy.\n\nStill, concerns remain. How long will it be before states reopen their economies? Will the economic recovery be V-shaped or U-shaped? Will there be a recovery at all, given the potential of the coronavirus to spread again, either when the economy reopens, or perhaps when cold weather returns? How will the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic affect people's behavior in the future? Will they still want to go to the movies, to restaurants, to sporting events, or will a hangover effect cast a pall over the economy? No one knows the answers to these questions, and until they do, there will be uncertainty regarding the prices of investments, including municipal bonds.\n\nDespite the challenges facing many muni bond issuers, investors should remember that investment-grade municipal bonds historically have experienced exceptionally low default rates, especially relative to US corporate bonds.\n\nMoody's Investors Services has studied default rates for municipal bonds and US corporate bonds from 1970 to 2018. During this time, the average cumulative default rate for investment-grade municipal bonds over all rolling 10-year periods was 0.10%. That means that of all the investment-grade municipal bonds at the beginning of the 10-year period 0.10% of the bonds based on market capitalization defaulted by the end of the 10-year period.\n\nThe average cumulative default rate for US corporate bonds over similarly rolling 10-year periods was 2.28% -- almost 23 times higher. High-yield municipal bonds defaulted at a much higher cumulative rate over the rolling 10-year periods -- specifically, at an average rate of 7.47%. But even this rate was only about one-fourth the cumulative default rate of US corporate high-yield bonds, which averaged 28.79%.\n\nInvestors attracted to the historically low default rates and tax advantages that munis offer can buy individual muni bonds, but professionally managed mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and separately managed accounts offer exposure to a wider variety of issuers and maturities than most investors would be able to achieve by buying individual bonds.\n\nFidelity has a number of tools to help investors screen through mutual funds and ETFs for research ideas. You can run screens yourself using the Mutual Fund or ETF screeners on Fidelity.com.

Among these are the $59 million bond issue that passed last November which is paving the way for several improvements to begin this summer and the $89 million bond passed in 2012. According to Assistant Superintendent for Business and Finance Mike Engelter, the reason for the refinancing is to take advantage of the exceptionally low interest rates right now. He expects the district to get an interest rate of between two and three per cent on the bonds, which he says will save \"millions of dollars\" in interest if refinanced over a 20-year period.\n\nEngelter says the district will go to prospective investors Tuesday, May 19th, with closing to take place a month later. The firm the district will be utilizing is Huntington Securities, Inc., a Birmingham, Michigan-based investment banking firm that specializes in brokerage, public finance, underwriting, trading, and institutional sales of municipal bonds.\n\nIn other action, the board approved establishing a line of credit for up to $6 million this summer to meet district financial obligations, including staff payroll and paying bills. According to Superintendent Greg Gray, the district may not need to use the line of credit, resulting in interest savings. But he says it is wise to have the line of credit there as a safety net. Gray says Brighton and other school districts can run into a cash flow issue during the summer, stemming from the fact that the state's fiscal year is different from that of local school districts. The state's fiscal year runs from Oct. 1-Sept. 30, while the fiscal year of school districts extends from July 1-June 30. This results in a lag time -- when districts can run short of funds to meet their financial obligations -- until the first state aid payment arrives in late Sept. or early Oct.", "uri": "6071948029", "url": "https://whmi.com/news/article/bas-board-votes-to-refinance-outstanding-debt"}], "6070821485": [106017953, {"sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "published_on": "2020-05-17T17:18:00Z", "name": "McCreath: Brace for 'really ugly' earnings and election risk - BNN Bloomberg", "dtype": "news", "pk": 106017953, "text": "As I write these thoughts on the markets, the S&P 500 has just bounced off the low end of its latest 2,800-2,950 range while the U.S. dollar, gold and oil continue to grind higher.\n\nThere's little question that financial markets have stabilized and equities have recovered half their losses thanks to the aggressive and gargantuan monetary support of the world's central banks.\n\nCentral bank actions, specifically by the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been exceptionally effective at ensuring that the short-term seizure in the plumbing of financial markets that we saw in late February and early March was reversed and re-instilled confidence among players in the financial markets. That's pretty obvious from reviewing the spreads of agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, municipal bonds and U.S./Euro swap rates in the next four graphs. Well done, Mr. Powell.\n\nMost importantly, the next four graphs suggest the plumbing of markets has been fixed.\n\nIn forming a view of where equities go from here, I believe we've moved into a hiatus period for any substantively incremental monetary stimulus or fiscal accommodation.\n\nSure we could get more of both, but I just think it won't be coming in the near term. Consequently, it's up to progress against COVID-19, the pace of the re-opening of the economy, and presumably corporate outlooks to determine whether equities pull back, bide their time within their most recent range, or keep grinding higher.\n\nLet's review the status of each of these variables.\n\nSo far, so good with respect to arresting the explosive growth in COVID-19 cases. The growth in new case counts in western Europe, ex-Italy, has stabilized, albeit at still somewhat elevated levels. In the U.S., while there's definitely several hot spots, the good news is the trajectory of the seven-day average, excluding the state of New York.\n\nFingers crossed these improvements continue but two points merit attention.\n\nFirst, we all know that the pace of re-opening is the epitome of a fine balance. Second, as the absolute number of cases is the highest it has been to date, the imperative of testing even more people becomes of paramount importance. Let's hope all governments adhere to that requirement.\n\nAs for the state of the economy, I'd argue the economic data we're seeing right now is irrelevant, whether it was last week's U.S. retail sales miss or better than expected industrial production data from China. That's because the data that we'll get during the next two months is almost guaranteed to be universally worse.\n\nThe question is what the eventual recovery in U.S. GDP is going to look like.\n\nAs recently as last week, it appeared that consensus, or what may be priced into equities, thought the U.S. economy could be back at 70 per cent of its capacity by Labour Day. That strikes me as being optimistic, and of course that's why I believe markets will wait for supporting evidence before exhibiting any grind higher. Let's face it, it's anybody's guess.\n\nAs for earnings, 91.9 per cent of the S&P 500's market cap has reported first-quarter results. Year-over-year rates of growth in revenue and earnings have been +0.6 per cent and -13.4 per cent, respectively (-6.2 per cent for profits if financials are excluded).\n\nHowever, similar to GDP, it's the second quarter that's going to be really ugly, while the pace of the recovery will determine whether 2020 earnings per share for the S&P 500 will remain near the US$130-$140 consensus or move lower. We should know the answer by mid-July.\n\nI'm in the camp that once growth normalizes, say 12 months from now, that U.S. GDP growth will remain tepid, say in the range of 1.8 to two per cent, with a lower number here at home in Canada. Such an outcome would support a continuation in the long-term trend of slowing corporate revenue growth.\n\nAs for earnings, sure rates are even lower today, but what's the outlook for corporate taxes? Hard to believe they don't go up. And what about labour costs? Since part of U.S. President Donald Trump's current fiscal accommodation has dislocated workers getting paid US$25 per hour, it's tough to argue against a minimum wage of at least US$15 per hour.\n\nIf I'm correct and economic growth doesn't pick up during the next 18 months, can equity leadership change? Sure, as the economy re-opens I suspect we'll see a tactical shift toward value and cyclical stocks and a back-up in long-term bond yields due to a belief that renewed inflation is around the corner.\n\nHowever, once growth normalizes in a year or so, as I stated above, I believe neither growth nor inflation will accelerate. Of course, such an event doesn't speak well to the ultimate upside in stocks as valuations on growth stocks aren't exactly cheap.\n\nThat's the cup half-empty argument, in contrast to others such as JP Morgan Quant Strategist Marko Kolvanic, who believes central bank liquidity will further expand valuations. Such a pitch is entirely possible; but, as I've told many clients over the past several weeks, I'm not the guy to get really long the market because I believe the price to earnings multiple is going to expand from the current 21X to 24X.\n\nAt Forge First, we're value investors focused on buying companies that generate free cash flow, ideally offering free cash flow yields of at least eight to 12 per cent, while shorting companies that either burn cash or require continued access to financial markets to finance their business.\n\nFor economic growth to accelerate beyond my expectations, and for inflation to pick up, the velocity of money has to get up off the bottom.\n\nAs shown by the orange line in the 45-year graph below, this key variable has been on a steady course downward since 1995. In looking back at the experience of 2008, both government spending and the growth in money supply picked up markedly. However, post-crisis, the marked tightening in fiscal policy is likely one reason why inflation didn't accelerate. This cycle, the apparent limitless amount of stimulus and accommodation has rekindled fears of inflation. Yet for at least the next couple of years I don't buy that pitch given the disinflationary trends in the economy and the growing tendency to hoard cash.\n\nVelocity must turn if the U.S. is to experience a return to growth and inflation\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAnd while the topic of inflation is receiving much attention, the graph below shows that it's sure not getting priced into the financial markets. What this graph suggests is that in five years, the rate of inflation for the subsequent five years will only average 1.38 per cent.\n\nU.S. five-year forward breakeven: Proxy for inflation in the next five years, starting five years from now\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nIt's these concerns that inflation won't pick up that has fostered recent dialogue about the Fed moving toward negative interest rate policy (NIRP). While last week's remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell appeared to put an end to the discussion of NIRP, markets (be it just technical factors or otherwise) are still pricing in such a possibility. I'm totally against negative interest rates. This policy hasn't worked anywhere else plus it could materially disrupt the perceived house of safety for cash: money markets.\n\nTaxable U.S. money market fund assets now exceed US$4.6 trillion\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nOne other item markets are going to begin to consider over the summer is the U.S. Presidential election. While November 3 seems like it is a long way away, it's wrong not to consider what a Democratic sweep could mean for financial markets. Presumptive Democratic Nominee Joe Biden has stated that he'd raise corporate taxes and it would be likely that many of Trump's actions to slash regulation and environmental protection would be reversed once again.\n\nLast but not least, the other day I read a report published by the C.D. Howe Institute about Canada's fiscal position. (Here's the link to the report). It is an understatement to say that it's a sobering read. The baseline scenario projects deficits of $73 billion next year, and more than $50 billion per year from 2022-23 to 2024-25 such that federal debt reaches 49.1 per cent of GDP by 2025. Total federal debt appears poised to eventually exceed $1 trillion. Combined with huge provincial levels of debt, this financial burden will leave Canada in a real conundrum. The highest marginal tax rate in many provinces is already over 50 per cent. It's unfathomable to contemplate even higher tax rates than we have today, but do you really think Ottawa will cut services?

He is the founder of Double Line Capital LP which is an investment firm. He has been the Head of the TCW Total Return Bond Fund before this.\n\nEarly and Personal Life:\n\nJeffrey was born on 30 October 1959 in Amherst, New York. His father Arthur E. Gundlach worked as a chemist and his mother Carol Gundlach was a homemaker.\n\nHe graduated as the summa cum laude in Math & Philosophy in 1981 from Dartmouth College after which he attended Yale University for pursuing his degree PhD. in theoretical Mathematics but eventually he dropped out. He was married to Nancy Draper who was a bassist in his very own band \"Radical Flat\" (initially called \"The Greens\"), who filed for a divorce after 20 years of marriage in 2010.\n\nIt is said he is an avid art collector and owns great works by artists such as Warhol, Mondrian, and many more. In 2012, a Home burglary took place where pieces of arts, expensive designer watches, cash, and his red Porsche was stolen. After labeling a reward of 1 million, the artworks were discovered and cops arrested those who were the suspects for the theft.\n\nGundlach was the Head of $9.3 billion TCW, where he finished as top 2% of all funds invested for 10 years after which in 2009, he was fired from TCW. He was sued by TCW for stealing confidential data, lying to the clients, and keeping drugs, pornographic materials in his office. They said that he was an asset to the organization and an award-winning fund manager. Butt he had broken the contract by giving out misappropriate trade secrets among many other civil charges. Drugs and Pornographic materials found in his office also violated the firm's rules and regulations.\n\nCurrently, he is working with Double Line Capital and he is the co-founder of this Mutual Funds Company managing more than $140 billion in assets. In February 2011 cover story, Barron's tagged him as the \"King of Bonds\". In an interview with CNBC on 9 March 2011, he said, \"Munis are the New Subprime\" and that \"You've got a history of low defaults, which is comforting. But that kind of sounds like what subprime sounded back in 2006.\"\n\nHe is known for his bold calls and he predicted the housing crash that happened in 2007. In 2011, he liquidated around 55% of his personal holdings in Municipal Bonds. Although the decline did not occur on the day he predicted but happened around the end of 2011. He has been listed in the 50 Most Influential List by Bloomberg. He was also in 69 position in the list of most powerful people of 2014.\n\nHis primary income is basically from his job and investments. He was included in the Forbes 400 in 2019 and Billionaires of 2020 as well. His net worth is estimated to be somewhere around $1.6 billion. In 2019 it was about $1.4 billion.

In addition to directly helping clients with wealth management issues, they also head a team -- the Franklin Avenue Group -- consisting of ten FAs and support staff. Both are credentialed as Certified Financial Planners and have been at Morgan Stanley for many years. Morgan Stanley is the world's largest wealth management firm and has almost 16,000 FAs, 60,000 employees, and operations in 42 countries. FAs work for the firm's Wealth Management business, but Morgan Stanley also has investment banking, investment management, commercial banking and other businesses.\n\nIn 2018, Morgan Stanley rolled out a new capability to its FAs to aid them in their work with clients. Called Next Best Action (NBA), the system is both a platform for personalized communication and engagement with clients, and an AI-based recommendation engine for investment and wealth management ideas that FAs can present to their clients. The NBA system, if used correctly, has the potential to significantly change the ways FAs work with their clients and do their jobs. Usage of the system is voluntary, but some individuals and teams -- including Maguire, Brown, and the Franklin Avenue Group -- are seeing very positive impacts from extensive usage. In the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the system became even more important for the Wealth Management business when face-to-face meetings between advisors and clients were impossible. In the first two months of the pandemic, the NBA system was used over 11 million times.\n\nWhat Effective Financial Advisors Do\n\nThere are a variety of different approaches that FAs take to working with their clients. The traditional approach is to offer transactional investing, recommending particular securities (individual stocks or bonds, or alternative investments) to clients. It is more common recently -- in part as commissions on securities transactions have fallen throughout the industry -- to take an advisory-oriented wealth management approach to client relationships. As Rich Brown's LinkedIn page describes his job:\n\nBrown and Maguire are both oriented to wealth management, although some of the FAs on their team tend to be somewhat more transactional in their investment recommendations. Wealth managers are less likely to recommend individual securities, and more likely to advocate the buying and longer-term holding of model portfolios, mutual funds, ETFs, tax-efficient investments like municipal bonds. They typically develop financial plans for their clients to help them achieve their long-term goals -- often retirement-oriented. They may also assist clients with their estate plans and help them to establish trusts for their heirs.\n\nJeff McMillan, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's Chief Analytics and Data Officer, led the development of the NBA system and manages data on the Wealth Management unit's performance. He noted that there is one primary factor in the success of FAs:\n\nEngaging with clients entails having frequent, relevant, and trustworthy communications with them. But communicating frequently and ensuring relevance have historically been time-consuming for FAs. With the average number of clients per FA at about 200, FAs need to combine engagement with efficiency. Fortunately, that's just what the NBA system offers them.\n\nHow the Franklin Avenue Group Uses the NBA System\n\nBrown and Maguire say they use the NBA system for \"a lot of different things.\" Some involve routine communications -- birthday greetings, holiday messages, passage of the SECURE Act by the U.S. Congress, etc. The system makes it easy to specify message filters, so storm warnings, for example, can be sent only to certain zip codes. The messaging is very efficient; the group has about 1800 clients, and a typical message can be tailored and sent out in about ten minutes. All communications can include highly personalized content. For example, if there is a major stock market decline, the automatically-sent message can include the specific impact on the client's portfolio.\n\nIn addition to semi-generic messages to clients, the NBA system also recommends a set of investment ideas that FAs can send to clients -- \"ideas to engage,\" it calls them. There might be twenty or so possible ideas to send to clients in a particular day, but FAs decide whether to send them. They might, for example, tell a client with a particular bond that it has been downgraded, and recommend an alternative. It might also say that a client has just added $100,000 to their account, and to contact them to discuss ideas for investing it. If a mutual fund or ETF has a change in management, the system might suggest contacting the client to discuss whether to stay with the fund. Near the end of the tax year, it might suggest some tax loss harvesting opportunities to suggest to the client. In this context, the NBA system is used to transition a client to a more actively-managed portfolio.\n\nThe NBA system also makes recommendations on the risk level and issues within a portfolio, based on a partnership with BlackRock and its Aladdin Wealth risk management system. It screens client portfolios for various types of risk on an ongoing basis. If Aladdin discovers a high level of risk, the client is notified and encouraged to discuss it with the FA.\n\nBrown and Maguire note that the NBA system may alert clients of a particular issue, but that often is not what the client calls to discuss:\n\nAs McMillan describes the system:\n\nThe system has made the Franklin Avenue Group much more efficient. The group's goal is to contact the client every 30 to 90 days, and the NBA system makes personalized client contact much easier. Freeing up the FAs from routine communications means that they have more time to meet with clients -- for example, in two-hour planning sessions. Further, the group doesn't have to hire staff to handle communications; Brown and Maguire handle messaging for the entire team.\n\nJeff McMillan says that Morgan Stanley's data shows a definite increase in FA productivity.\n\nHow the NBA System Is Changing the FA Role\n\nBrown and Maguire admit that not everybody is equally comfortable with the system. They said that some older FAs don't use it as much, and sometimes wonder why they are receiving a lot of inbound calls. They could monitor what outbound messages go out, but they may not do so. Older Financial Advisors are also more likely to take an individual security, transaction-based relationship with clients. The NBA system supports that approach as well, but Brown and Maguire prefer a more advisory wealth management approach.\n\nBrown and Maguire said that they personally try to be early adopters of new technologies, and the NBA system is no exception. The FAs on their team who do best with the system are similar to them in their embrace of technology. The best use of the system also requires FAs to gather information about their clients' preferences, family, and hobbies -- again, an investment in the relationship focus. Brown and Maguire agree that the aggressive users of NBA on the team are more likely to build scale -- more client relationships and more assets under management -- and be more effective. For example, if they understand how the system works, they can track whether a client has opened an email with an investment idea. If the client doesn't open the message, they know that they need to make an outbound call. They call also look at the machine learning-generated scores to see how likely a particular investment idea is to appeal to a particular client.\n\nJeff McMillan, the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Chief Analytics and Data Officer, said that their analyses suggest that the FA job is changing:\n\nIt's common in wealth management circles to mention the need for a \"trusted advisor,\" but that attribute was historically based on personal characteristics alone. Morgan Stanley believes that a trusting relationship also involves expectations of bringing the best possible investment advice to clients based on data and advanced analytics. The best financial advisors of the future will have the best personal relationships as well as the best data-driven advice -- not only about financial investments, but about life.", "uri": "6069996465", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2020/05/16/the-future-of-work-now-morgan-stanleys-financial-advisors-and-the-next-best-offer-system/"}], "6069996039": [440398245, {"sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "published_on": "2020-05-16T19:16:00Z", "name": "The Future Of Work Now: Morgan Stanley's Financial Advisors And The Next Best Offer System - Business Quick Magazine", "dtype": "news", "pk": 440398245, "text": "Rich Brown and Christian Maguire are financial advisors (FAs) for Morgan Stanley in the New York City area.

Enter the \"13(3) facilities.\"\n\nThere has been huge hoopla about the Fed stepping into the markets and buying investment-grade corporate bonds and \"fallen-angel\" junk bonds, syndicated leveraged loans, CLOs (collateralized loan obligations), bond ETFs, and even junk-bond ETFs. The first intentions were announced in March and then expanded to include more asset classes and lower credit ratings. The Fed also announced that it would buy bonds and slices of syndicated loans directly from issuing companies, thereby providing emergency funding directly to companies that are solvent but cannot fund themselves because credit markets have frozen up. So what has the Fed actually done -- and under what \"authority?\"\n\nThree of the actions happened quickly: The money-market bailout (blue in the chart below), emergency funding for corporations (black), and loans to its Primary Dealers to be used to get markets to \"function smoothly\" (gray). They started showing up on the Fed's weekly balance sheet in mid-March. But they soon began to taper off as the panic faded and as they were being unwound. In April, the Paycheck Protection Program loans to banks and some dollops of Commercial Paper started to show up. They filled the hole left behind by the shrinking first three.\n\nThe balance of all these alphabet-soup programs combined has declined from $130 billion on April 8 to $120 billion on May 13, as reflected on the Fed's balance sheet released today. And none of the juicy stuff that the markets have so eagerly rallied upon - investment-grade and junk-rated corporate bonds and ETFs, CLOs, leveraged loans, etc. - happened until this week, and now it's just a tiny wee bit, $305 million (with an M), the \"CCF,\" a yellow line on top of the green segment in the last column:\n\nThat's what Fed Chair Jerome Powell called them yesterday during the Q&A - \"thirteen-three facilities,\" is how he said it.\n\nThis \"13(3)\" refers to Section 13 paragraph 3 of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1991 and then again in 2010 with the Dodd-Frank Act, which attempted to put some limits on what the Fed can do under this 13(3).\n\nThe section as amended allows the Fed, \"in unusual and exigent circumstances,\" to lend to individuals, partnerships, and corporations that are not banks (the Fed already lends to banks on a routine basis). According to Business Law Today, the limits set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act include:\n\nSuch lending must now be made in connection with a \"program or facility with broad-based eligibility,\" cannot \"aid a failing financial company\" or \"borrowers that are insolvent,\" and cannot have \"a purpose of assisting a single and specific company avoid bankruptcy\" or similar resolution.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve cannot establish a section 13(3) program without the prior approval of the secretary of the Treasury.\n\nRevised section 13(3) could be used to create facilities like the alphabet facilities of the financial crisis mentioned above [which is what we now face], but the intent of the revisions was to preclude loans like those to JPMorgan/Bear Stearns and AIG.\n\nIn its explanations of the alphabet-soup of bailout-and-enrichment programs, the Fed always refers to 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act as the source of \"authority.\" The Fed sets up Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) as Limited Liability Corporations. The US Treasury (taxpayer) provides the equity cushion. The Fed lends to the SPV to leverage it 10-to-1. The SPV buys the securities. And Powell refers to these creatures as \"13(3) facilities.\"\n\nThe current generation of 13(3) facilities is still incomplete. The SPVs for TALF, municipal bonds, and others have not yet shown up. But so far, this is what the Fed has on its balance sheet, and what is depicted in the above chart. The amounts are what the Fed lent to these SPVs and don't include the equity cushion from the Treasury (the colors refer to the chart above):\n\nPrimary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF, black): $24 billion, down from $50 billion on March 25. This SPV can lend directly to companies by buying bonds directly from companies, including certain \"fallen angel\" junk bonds; it can also buy portions of syndicated loans or bonds at issuance.\n\nSecondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF): $0. This SPV can purchase corporate bonds, bond ETFs, and junk-bond ETFs in the secondary market, but hasn't purchased anything yet.\n\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF, gray): $10 billion down from $33 billion on April 15. These are loans to the Fed's primary dealers that they use to buy securities to support the smooth functioning of the market.\n\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF, blue): $40 billion, down from $53 billion on April 8. This SPV buys short-term commercial paper and other assets that money market mutual funds normally buy. During the panic, this allowed money market funds to sell those assets to meet redemptions.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF, red): $41 billion, up from $0 a month ago. This SPV buys from banks the government-guaranteed loans they issued to small businesses under the PPP. The primary target seems to have been Wells Fargo, which refused to participate in PPP because it was bumping into its Fed-imposed limits on its assets (loans). By buying these loans, the Fed takes them off the books of the banks.\n\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility LLC (CPFF, green): $4.3 billion, up from $0 on April 8. This SPV buys commercial paper, which are short-term corporate securities, to keep the corporate paper market liquid. The amounts are relatively tiny: $4 billion on a $7 trillion balance sheet.\n\nCorporate Credit Facility (CCF, yellow): $305 million. Halleluiah, this SPV, managed by State Street as the custodian, has bought some corporate credit in the secondary market, some kind of corporate bonds, a whopping $305 million with an M.\n\nBut there are other signs that the gears are turning, that the mechanisms are getting set up. In addition to State Street, the Fed has hired BlackRock and PIMCO. They're the custodians. The New York Fed gives them instructions.\n\nThe Fed appears to be in no hurry to get into corporate bonds and junk bonds and ETFs. Two months into it, and it has now bought $305 million, less than a rounding error on its balance sheet.

By the afternoon, Larry Kudlow, the Director of the White House National Economic Council, was on Fox News telling Sean Hannity that President Donald Trump was going to take the legislation under consideration, however the administration is likely to come back with a differently targeted economic approach when it comes down to state and local governments, especially incorporating an infrastructure component.\n\nKudlow Friday morning shifted the discussion to an incentive-based approach to things which undergirds the point of this commentary, albeit one which is twinned with targeted security money to stabilize markets. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has thrown in indicating a route to a deal, albeit he sees it as a big gulf to bridge.\n\nThe breaking news from the Trump Administration that TSMC will invest to set up a $12 billion chip factory in Arizona makes this discussion of practical near term importance. It will be a partnership between the federal, state, and local governments. Also, Apple will make long term purchases from TSMC for products produced in the facilities.\n\nThis project will likely involve substantial outlays of infrastructure dollars from the State, municipalities, and public entities. Facilities of this scale have unique needs with typical sectoral investments being transportation, water and energy intensive and requiring government partners to make their costs of usage low.\n\nAs a result, the muni market will be called upon here to deliver results in a way targeted at producing economic growth. Projects such as this one are in the works in many places of varying size, I am advising governments and private investors in several. So, I know from broad market participation and first hand on the deal front that the participants require and expect the infrastructure stimulus vehicles discussed here to be enacted and put to work.\n\nThere are, in practice, a limited number of ways to invest in infrastructure and it is impossible to do so without getting involved in state and municipal financing from an effectiveness perspective putting aside cost, because government entities are the primary way the federal government moves its money into the market. So, Democrats and Republicans are now sorting out the mix and extent of direct outlay into the economy through state and local entities and how it will be targeted.\n\nIn other words, we do not know when a large-scale infrastructure package will come, but we do know that we will see plenty of infrastructure stimulus on our way. It started with the airports, next we had the Federal Reserve program, targeted agency support, and infrastructure tied up directly into the COVID-19 support. More is on its way in a form still being worked through including how additional tranches will unfold under consideration.\n\nInvariably, infrastructure spending is within popular discussions associated with direct grants, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act shovel-ready program. In practice though, the federal government mainly invests in infrastructure through vehicles that leverage modest amounts of federal money to bring in much larger sums of outside capital from states, municipalities, private investors, and non-profit entities.\n\nIn fact, the direct grant approach has not traditionally been a successful durable solution in financial crises from the Great Depression to the 2008 financial crisis, albeit remarkable achievements and seismic progress were achieved in certain states during both of those periods. Alan Krueger, the Chief Economist for the U.S. Treasury Department during the latter crisis, singled out one of the main leveraging bond vehicles as the \"unsung hero of the recovery.\"\n\nAs a result, we should not be overly absorbed into discussions equating an infrastructure stimulus with the reintroduction of a shovel-ready approach to infrastructure investment. Direct grants will be used judiciously and in a targeted manner rather than a large-scale opening up of the federal government's purse. This money will focus on triage directed at critical essential infrastructure whose challenges are directly caused by COVID-19, not unlike elements of the HEREOS Act provisions.\n\nRather, we should look to previous leveraging programs such as the Depression Era quasi-public authorities, Reconstruction Finance Corporation, among others as models. Most germane though are the 52 leveraging programs introduced during the recent financial crisis which touched on every sector, were housed within every federal agency, and were used aggressively by both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nOver a dozen of these vehicles were muni market programs. They included the Build America Bonds, non-AMT private activity bonds, Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds, Recovery Zone Facility Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Zone Academy Bonds, Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds, Expanded Enhanced Industrial Development Bond, among others. Importantly, states and municipalities blended these vehicles together as well as with additional existing or innovative and traditional programs.\n\nThese vehicles were not preoccupied with lowering the cost of capital for issuers although that was an important aspect. They instead served essential functions such as initiating greenfield capital projects, sustaining the operating and maintenance elements of projects, catalyzing the unlocking of capital through the restructuring of balance sheets, providing an opportunity to sustain long-term planning initiatives, fostering the sustenance of vital sectors in a targeted manner, and offering special shots of support to hard-hit neighborhoods. These are incentive-driven economic growth stimulus programs not fill-ins, although that is part of their function in so far as they are a component of growth stimulus.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department incentivized their usage in a number of ways. Some were capped in permissible issuance amounts and others were not. Some had windows of usage which remained open for some time while others opened and closed quickly. At times, usage was encouraged through cash subsidies to issuers and, at other times, through the fee structures of service providers.\n\nThese programs last time around were used in wildly different ways and unevenly by public entities across the country and from sector-to-sector. Moreover, a number went unused for at least a quarter of early 2009, such as the Build America Bonds which were not simply a reducer of the cost of capital.\n\nAs happened throughout the 2008 financial crisis, we are working with governors and other institutionally sound public entities to prepare to use these types of vehicles right out of the gate, effectively, and at scale. Governors and public entities are focused not only on single or bundled project approaches, but also on stand-alone special purpose funds, special offices established to optimize usage, inter-agency coordination mechanisms, among others.\n\nThis type of government entrepreneurship is essential. The route to economic growth will be optimized if we treat our COVID-19 mission-critical infrastructure government entities as themselves fiscally prudent entrepreneurs with a long-term outlook. Doing so means some form of HEREOS Act type support as essential regardless of the amount and distributional formulas Washington settles on.\n\nAt the same time, that money can have so much more bang for the buck if we provide targeted, sound tools to scale economic growth impacts. In fact, many of our state and municipal corporations and also quasi public entities were created and have sustained over time because of their mix of entrepreneurialism, ability to make difficult business decisions attuned to public consequences, and effectiveness as a catalytic force in growing our nation.\n\nSure, we are in for a rough ride and the government and private sector each have their own role to play and will do it with mixed success in partnership and at odds with one another, but still keep in mind that many the Fortune 500 companies have not endured and thrived for as long as our substantial public entities have. As well, over time, many private startups have made it big while others have come and gone. Small businesses are a backbone of our economy. Many of our small- and medium-sized entities too have proved durable with their public utility mindset and an entrepreneurship. Let's give them the array of tools they need to optimize their role in our community and to do their very best to assist private sector enterprises in getting their mission critical jobs done too.", "uri": "6069224901", "url": "https://www.bondbuyer.com/opinion/lets-reward-prudent-government-entrepreneurism"}], "6069039368": [308730546, {"sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "published_on": "2020-05-15T19:05:00Z", "name": "Fed opens doors to issuers for MLF program", "dtype": "news", "pk": 308730546, "text": "The Federal Reserve is now accepting letters of interest from issuers for its municipal short-note program, which suggests it won't be long before states and local governments are able to start securing financing -- if they chose to go that route.\n\nThe yet-to-be-implemented Municipal Liquidity Facility has also yet to be helpful for the market, it has a \"long way to go\" is \"expensive\" and really meant for the lowest-rated issuers as the market is already clamoring for high-grade paper, analysts said. They added that those higher-rated issuers might be better served to stick with the municipal market itself. Sources said that was the Fed's intention when creating this program.\n\nSome issuers said they may not even use it when it goes into effect in the next few weeks, according to the Government Finance Officers Association and other issuers.\n\nAlso on Friday, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., led a bipartisan group in asking Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell to create a program to further help municipalities in the medium and long term.\n\n\"Establishing a facility to purchase municipal bonds from issuers and in the secondary market across all points of the yield curve would ensure state and local governments across the country can meet their financing needs as they respond to the health crisis and lay the foundation for future economic growth,\" lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe Fed released a Notice of Interest Friday morning, a form issuers must fill out to express interest in selling notes under the Fed's Municipal Liquidity Facility.\n\n\"I perceive this as the MLF is open for business,\" said Michael Decker, senior vice president of policy and research at Bond Dealers of America. \"The notice of interest they specify in today's announcement is the first step to securing financing with the facility. They are now open to accepting notices of interest, which suggest to me that it won't be long before they approve transactions.\"\n\nAs for the timing of the Fed accepting NOIs, the Fed likely wants to get a better grasp of who will be using the program, said Ben Watkins, Florida's director of Bond Finance.\n\n\"I'm sure the facility isn't ready, but they want to get some view of the landscape in terms of what the uptake might be, in terms of who and how much,\" Watkins said.\n\nThe Fed noted in the release that issuers should submit their NOIs only when it has determined its financial needs and schedule.\n\nMany issuers do not know what their financial needs are yet, so it is unlikely for there to be a \"mad rush\" to fill out NOIs for the program, Watkins said.\n\n\"It's going to take some time for that to develop in terms of being prepared to understand what the depth of the need is -- translated to dollar amount of borrowing,\" Watkins said. \"That will be challenging for people, I don't think people are ready for it.\"\n\nWatkins doesn't expect the state of Florida to participate in the MLF due to legal impediments and the state's strong liquidity.\n\n\"We're well-positioned in the near term through the end of June,\" Watkins said. \"If we continue with this shutdown and we don't see a pretty quick snapback on the economy then that could be a different story altogether.\"\n\nMarion Gee, director of finance at the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and incoming Government Finance Officers Association president, said issuers may not know immediately their need given the pandemic has lasted just about two months so far.\n\n\"Trying to really get a feel for how much you need this quickly may be difficult,\" Gee said.\n\nThe state of Wisconsin, like other issuers, may also need to wait to see COVID-19's financial impact.\n\n\"For the state of Wisconsin, we have not yet released any estimate on what this means on a revenue or budget perspective,\" said David Erdman, Wisconsin's capital finance director. \"It may be a few more weeks before we're about to do that. A lot of other issuers are in the same boat.\"\n\nHowever, Friday's news shows the Fed is committed to opening up the MLF in a timely manner, Erdman said.\n\nDealer groups were pleased with the news, calling it a significant step.\n\n\"Today's release of the issuer Notice of Interest form is another important milepost,\" said Leslie Norwood, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's managing director and associate general counsel. \"The dealer community stands at the ready to facilitate where we can be helpful.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Fed also announced that BLX Group LLC was designated as the administrative agent for the special purpose vehicle in the MLF purchasing the notes.\n\nThe American Securities Association noted potential conflicts of interest in choosing BLX.\n\n\"We are pleased the NY Fed is moving forward to set up the MLF, we hope its chosen advisors will acknowledge the conflicts of interest it now faces as it carries out its new role,\" said Chris Iacovella, ASA CEO. \"Promoting trust and confidence in our markets is paramount, especially in extraordinary circumstances such as these.\"\n\nMeanwhile, during a webinar put on by the Volcker Alliance and the Penn Institute for Urban Research on Thursday, Peter Hayes, managing director, chief investment officer and head of the municipal bond group within global fixed income at BlackRock, said \"I think the [Municipal Liquidity Facility] still has a way to go before it will be utilized and help the market per se.\"\n\nHayes noted the primary market has not been functioning \"anywhere close\" to what it was pre-COVID, though markets have since begun recovering somewhat since the March sell-off.\n\nThe perception was that the initial announcement of the MLF program would calm markets to signal that the Fed would work as a backstop for issuers, and the second notice would be the Fed actually starting to buy securities.\n\n\"That is still not the case, we don't know what the outcome of that will be. It hasn't been discussed and perhaps a better-functioning market doesn't need it to be.\"\n\nThe Government Finance Officers Association's debt committee members were straw-polled after the pricing information was released this week to see whether they would use the MLF.\n\n\"There were no takers on the debt committee,\" said Emily Brock, Director of GFOA's federal liaison center. \"I think though it's because there are a fair amount of issuers who are finding capital in other ways.\" Brock noted that a number of the debt committee members are smaller issuers who will not benefit from the program anyway.\n\nIndeed, issuers have been coming to market and large new-issues have been priced, albeit sometimes at a premium. Additionally, a larger number of issuers have been going directly to banks for private placements and bank loans and lines of credit, signals that issuers still have other means to access capital.\n\nPatrick Brett, managing director and head of Citi's Municipal Debt Capital Markets and Capital Solutions businesses said the original idea of the MLF was to help with issuers' cash-flow issues and stop those from becoming credit issues.\n\nRates in the MLF, compared to the rest of the market, don't make sense for most issuers to use the program, Brett said, except for the lowest-rated issuers or issuers that need to do larger amounts of borrowing.\n\nThe program, announced in early April, will buy $500 billion of short-term notes from issuers. On Monday the Fed announced a baseline of 150 basis points for triple-A issuers to 590 points for below investment-grade-rated issuers to use the MLF -- a large premium.\n\n\"Even if the facility isn't used by those entities, I think it will be a very useful backstop for those types of entities,\" Brett said.\n\nAn Illinois deal this week had similar pricing to the Fed's pricing models, Hayes noted.\n\nHayes said pricing in the MLF is expensive and said Illinois' spread on its $800 million deal this week correlated with what the MLF laid out.\n\nIllinois is rated at the lowest investment grade level of Baa3/BBB-minus with a negative outlook. Yields on its deals ranged from 4.87% to 5.85%.\n\nIn the MLF, issuers with ratings of Baa3/BBB-, spreads would be at 380 basis points and below investment grade at 590. Illinois' spreads were pretty close to the MLF's pricing, meaning the MLF may have priced it right, Hayes said.\n\n\"There is a lot of guesswork going into municipal pricing,\" Hayes said. \"In Illinois, why a spread of over 500? Because the market is extrapolating some pretty bad numbers that will occur in the state of Illinois.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brock also discussed amendments to the MLF in the House of Representatives' HEROES Act, which is to be voted on Friday. The bill would give $915 billion in direct federal aid to state and local governments.\n\nProposed changes to the MLF include extending the borrowing term from 36 months to 10 years, minimizing administrative hurdles, increasing access to issuers such as Washington D.C., and requiring borrowing at the Federal funds rate.", "uri": "6069039368", "url": "https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/fed-opens-doors-to-issuers-for-mlf-program"}], "6069023963": [774691659, {"sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "published_on": "2020-05-15T19:34:00Z", "name": "Brown Joins Bipartisan Request for Additional Measures to Ease Borrowing Costs for State and Local Governments Fighting Covid-19 | U.S. Senator for Ohio", "dtype": "news", "pk": 774691659, "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in a letter asking Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Jerome Powell, to consider additional measures to ease the borrowing costs for state and local governments fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

The question, of course, is where do we go from here?\n\nBy Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist\n\nWe share three diverse views on asset allocation strategy, US municipal bonds, and global equities\n\nAs the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, so do unemployment rates. And so the world continues to look for balance between implementing public health measures, offering fiscal and monetary stimulus, and opening up economies.\n\nAt the same time, investors are looking for ways to position their portfolios in this environment. In this piece, we hear from three portfolio management teams with diverse perspectives on ways that COVID-19 has impacted their areas of investment expertise. The first discusses three potential scenarios for the year ahead and what they could mean for asset allocation decisions. The second examines how the Federal Reserve's response to this crisis has helped bolster the US municipal market. And the third eschews market outlooks altogether in favor of a different question pertinent to global equities: \"How is the world changing?\"\n\nAlessio de Longis & Jacob Borbidge. It took 11 years, but the longest lasting bull market on record has ended. Years from now, hindsight may suggest that the closing of the US and European economies, a previously unimaginable concept, was all but inevitable to contain COVID-19. But in reality, the outbreak took markets by surprise. The question, of course, is where do we go from here? While it is impossible to make predictions about COVID-19 related medical advancements, Invesco Investment Solutions has focused our attention on possible scenarios pertaining to the duration of the pandemic and how its impact on economic data and growth expectations may drive our investment process. Specifically, we have embedded the expectation of a U-shaped recession as our \"base\" case. Our objective is not to identify the most likely scenario and position our portfolios accordingly for the next 12 months; rather, it is to evaluate the most likely range of market outcomes, their associated risks and investment implications.\n\nBase scenario: In this scenario, economic recovery would begin in the third quarter, but we would expect sideways markets with bouts of volatility as lack of a vaccine presents the risk of a second wave outbreak in the fall. Investment implications: In this case, we would favor average risk exposure, with an overweight to credit assets and an underweight to equities and government bonds. Within fixed income, we would consider overweighting high-quality credit (such as investment grade corporate and municipal debt) or a combination of riskier credit (such as high yield) and long-dated, longer-duration government bonds - while reducing exposure in short- and medium-term government bond maturities. Within equities, we may favor US stocks over other developed markets and emerging markets, growth over value, large caps over small caps, and defensive factors such as quality and low volatility.\n\nBear scenario: In this scenario, we could face a prolonged contraction of more than a year if the effects of COVID-19 are more severe than anticipated and the economy struggles to reopen. Investment implications: In this case, we would expect broad-based risk aversion and outperformance of (relatively) defensive assets. We would favor below-average risk exposure, with overweight positions in long-duration government bonds and high-quality credit, favoring US dollar or US dollar-hedged assets given the potential for further US dollar appreciation. Other considerations include underweighting riskier credit assets, especially emerging markets local currency and hard currency debt, or underweighting equities, especially in emerging and developed markets outside of the US. Within equities, we would favor the areas highlighted in our base scenario (US stocks, growth, large caps and defensive factors).\n\nBull scenario: In this scenario, the news around COVID-19 would be positive, with a drop in cases and/or the emergence of medical developments. A recovery could take hold in the second half of 2020 and into 2021 as people return to work and the effects of previous stimulus measures provide support. Investment implications: In this case, we would expect broad-based outperformance in cyclical and risky asset classes. We would favor an above-average risk posture, with overweight exposures to riskier credit assets and equities, and underweight exposures to government bonds and high-quality credit. Within credit, we would favor high yield, structured credit, emerging market hard currency and local currency debt with the expectation that the US dollar depreciates. In equities, we may favor emerging markets and international developed markets over US stocks, value over growth, small caps over large caps, and underweight positions in factors at risk of short-term reversal effects such as low volatility and momentum.\n\nMark Paris: The municipal bond market has seen historic volatility since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. In mid-February, municipal investment grade yields were lower than their Treasury bond counterparts up and down the curve - which is typical given the tax-exempt status of munis. But by late March, rates for 10-year muni bonds were three times that of the corresponding Treasury note, and rates for 30-year munis were two times that of 30-year Treasuries.Why? Muni issuers did not have access to the market and liquidity was extremely thin. The mandated stay-at-home practices meant that as a society, we were not using the essential services that the muni market finances: Public transportation, airports and toll roads had their utilization greatly slashed, and therefore their revenue and fees as well. Also, hospital bonds were under pressure as COVID-19 cases overwhelmed their staff and put pressure on their balance sheets. The fear of downgrades and defaults and the flight to cash caused a major liquidity crunch as too many sellers and not enough buyers drove prices down. Muni funds went from positive flows to now negative numbers not seen since the Taper Tantrum sell-off of 2013.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve has instituted some programs to help both the municipal market and issuers. The Fed's purchase of short-term municipal floating rate notes relieved some pressure on short-term tender option bonds, which many muni managers utilize for leverage. The Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) plan is scheduled to launch soon as well, whereby the Fed will directly loan to certain municipalities for up to three years, but it is limited in scope as to which issuers are eligible. Funding for hospitals has been part of the early bills passed by Congress, but now there is heightened talk of a more comprehensive package that is targeted for municipalities. All of these actions have helped to somewhat stabilize the muni market in late April and the start of May. In addition, we believe that many muni issuers have come into this crisis from a period of strength as the economy was growing steadily beforehand. General obligation bond issuers had well-funded rainy-day funds, issuers such as airports and toll roads typically carry a large amount of cash on hand, and sales tax from internet purchases is still being collected even as many businesses are closed.\n\nWe believe the price dislocation in the muni market has been too drastic and that there is a disconnect between the fundamental credits and where they are trading in the marketplace. This is especially true for the high yield market, where we believe investors can earn a significant coupon in the short run while potentially gaining price appreciation in the longer term as spreads between munis and Treasuries tighten when economic growth recovers. In addition, as stimulus programs are instituted and the US government spends more, the potential for higher tax rates also looms large for individual investors, which could again create positive flows into tax-exempt munis. While this crisis continues to play out, we believe thorough credit research will be key to finding value in both investment grade and high yield muni issuers so that investors looking for tax-exempt income can potentially benefit from the market fluctuations.\n\nRandall Dishmon: I get asked all the time about my \"outlook\" for the market. My answer has been the same for nearly 20 years: \"I don't have one.\" I don't ... for good reason. I've not yet met the person who can consistently predict what the market is going to do, but even more importantly: I don't buy the market. In my view, the question itself is the real problem. I believe it shows a critical flaw in a person's thinking - the only reason to ask that question is to attempt to time the market ... a perfect example of what I call \"cyclical thinking.\" I don't like cyclical thinking. I believe it is one of the main enemies of the successful long-term investor.\n\nSuccessful investors, in my view, have to be expert at recognizing the difference between cyclical and structural trends. At the core of my investing philosophy is this: I look for structural trends. Simply put: \"How is the world changing?\" A perfect example that I've been investing in for my entire career is the rise of ecommerce. That's represented a steady change in the way business is done - it's not a cycle that leads to four years of ecommerce being favored and then a mean-reversion to four years of brick and mortar retail outperforming. That's the difference: Cyclical change separates markets into growth companies and value companies. Structural change separates the market into winners and losers. Losers don't mean revert - they go bankrupt. Like I said, it's important to recognize the difference.\n\nSo, here's my outlook, but not for the market ... for the structural growth trends that I believe are changing the world.\n\nI expect all of these trends to continue for at least the next decade - that kind of compounding makes short-term concerns meaningless to my investment process.\n\nTender option bonds are used to create leverage by borrowing from money market funds and investing in high quality municipal bonds.\n\nCredit spread is the difference between Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities that are identical in all respects except for quality rating.\n\nFixed-income investments are subject to credit risk of the issuer and the effects of changing interest rates. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. An issuer may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer's credit rating.\n\nMunicipal securities are subject to the risk that legislative or economic conditions could affect an issuer's ability to make payments of principal and/or interest.\n\nJunk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer's credit quality. The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods.\n\nGrowth stocks tend to be more sensitive to changes in their earnings and can be more volatile.\n\nDerivatives may be more volatile and less liquid than traditional investments and are subject to market, interest rate, credit, leverage, counterparty and management risks. An investment in a derivative could lose more than the cash amount invested.\n\nIn general, stock values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions.\n\nThe risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues.\n\nThe dollar value of foreign investments will be affected by changes in the exchange rates between the dollar and the currencies in which those investments are traded.\n\nStocks of small and mid-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale.\n\nA value style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns will trail other styles of investing or the overall stock markets.\n\nThe risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues.\n\nThe opinions referenced above are those of the author as of May 13, 2020.

As a result, credit spreads have tightened significantly from where they were in March. Since March 23, 2020, the option-adjusted spread on the S&P U.S. Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index tightened more than 150 bps, and yields were within only 50 bps of their all-time lows as of April 30, 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, municipal bonds experienced greater spread widening in March and did not see the extreme tightening that investment-grade corporate bonds did. As of April 30, 2020, the yield of the S&P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index was still more than 100 bps above its pre-COVID-19 low.\n\nGiven the recent rally in the corporate bond market, the tax-equivalent yield (TEY) of the S&P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index now exceeds the yield of the S&P U.S. Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index. Less than two months ago, the yield-to-worst of corporate bonds was more than 50 bps higher than the TEY of the S&P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index. Exhibit 1 compares the yield of the two indices over the past three years.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced it would be expanding its Municipal Lending Facility to provide support to smaller municipalities and local governments, as well as extending the duration of bonds it will cover. Undoubtedly, issuers of state and local debt will have to grapple with potentially large budget gaps as income tax, sales tax, and other revenue sources have been severely affected by the virus fallout.\n\nHowever, the overall credit quality of the municipal bond market is much better positioned to weather such potential hardships. Exhibit 2 compares the credit quality distribution of the S&P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index to that of the S&P U.S. Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index. While 55% of the investment-grade corporate bond market is 'BBB'-rated, less than 9% of municipal bonds fall into the lowest rung on the investment-grade ladder.\n\nCompared to corporate bonds, market participants can find relatively competitive yields in the municipal market while also benefitting from much higher credit quality. Additionally, as corporations continue to cut or suspend dividends for an unknown length of time, increasing exposure to municipal bonds provides participants with an opportunity to potentially supplement that missing yield.\n\nDisclosure: Copyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, a division of S&P Global.

Charles Samuels, an attorney at Mintz Levin, which represents the National Association of Health and Educational Facilities Finance Authorities, said Wednesday \"it's quite speculative\" whether a bill containing muni provisions will be enacted this year.\n\nSamuels, whose group includes nonprofit hospitals and colleges, is hopeful the limit for bank qualified loans will be increased to $30 million in that legislation.\n\nThis so-called small lender provision, which has bipartisan sponsors on the House Ways and Means Committee, would raise to $30 million from $10 million the deductibility of bank qualified debt and bank-eligible loans to nonprofits as a business cost. The bill also would set the $30 million on a borrower-by-borrower basis, rather than aggregating all bank-qualified bonds issued by a conduit issuer.\n\n\"Even on the Senate side, there's highway reauthorization and some energy legislation that's quite noncontroversial that we might see developing and that might become a vehicle for muni bond provisions,\" Samuel said.\n\nHe did not question the political calculation to exclude muni bond provisions from the HEROES Act.\n\n\"It is totally correct for the Speaker to first worry about survival and then worry about the future,\" Samuels said. \"It's quite a rational decision on her part.\"", "uri": "6067770227", "url": "https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/public-finance-advocates-confident-muni-provisions-will-come"}], "6067551825": [550130824, {"sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "published_on": "2020-05-14T15:21:00Z", "name": "Economic Data Reflects Shutdown, but Market Rallies | ETF Trends", "dtype": "news", "pk": 550130824, "text": "As April ends and May begins, we enter a new phase of this crisis with many states starting the re-opening process. While still in the early stages, the focus has now turned to how to restart the economy and get Americans back to work.\n\nThe volatility spike we experienced in March was unprecedented. The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the VIX or Fear Index, hit a record high during March surpassing any other point in its history dating back to January 1990. Only three times in the over 7,600 trading days since its inception has this index closed above 80, including March 16, 2020 when it closed at 82.69 - a record high close.\n\nIn last month's Benchmark Review, we acknowledged that these are indeed uncertain times, but we also believed that this current period was not the scariest time in the last 30 years as this reading seemed to indicate. Although too early to claim victory, equity markets calmed down dramatically in April and the VIX Index fell by about 60% to end the month around 34. This is still a high level for the VIX Index. The long-term average for the VIX Index is 19.3 and historically, it trades between 10-30 about 91% of the time and between 30-40 only about 5.5% of the time. We believe we will remain in a period of elevated capital market volatility for the foreseeable future.\n\nThough it is far from certain, we believe the worst of the virus and stock market news is behind us and that we are on a gradual road to recovery. Extremes had been reached on the pessimistic side when looking at market indicators like the VIX Index, trading sentiment and put/call ratios. Again, we noted in last month's Benchmark Review that we tend to see these types of extreme pessimistic readings when the market is at or near a bottom. We believe conditions are improving, but we are not so na\u00efve to think that things will get back to normal overnight. We think volatility will stay elevated and that we have a choppy road ahead as the reopening of the economy gradually begins.\n\nWe had anticipated a more volatile ride moving into 2020 due in part to valuations getting stretched after the year-end run in 2019, optimism reaching extreme levels (which can be a bearish indicator of complacency in the market), and normal election year volatility that markets historically experience in the first half of a presidential election year. We had even believed that a 5%-10% correction could materialize in the first part of 2020. After declining nearly 34%, incredibly, year-to-date the S&P 500 is down only -9.29% through April, which is more or less in-line with the type of \"normal\" market correction we believed was possible. We did not anticipate COVID-19, and the way we arrived at this point is anything but a run-of-the-mill 10% stock market correction, but we are where we are.\n\nWith this background, the equity rebound in April was dramatic, but stocks are still down year-to-date. The numbers for April were as follows: The S&P 500 gained 12.82%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved by 11.22%, the Russell 3000 advanced 13.24%, the NASDAQ Composite rallied 15.49% and the Russell 2000 Index, a measure of small-cap companies, rebounded by 13.74%. Significant divergences still exist among U.S. equity indices on a year-to-date basis and those declines through April (in the same order) were: -9.29%, -14.07%, -10.42%, -0.63%, and -21.08%, respectively.\n\nThe performance of the S&P has been driven by some of the largest companies in this index as the five largest companies have become a bigger overall percentage of this market-cap weighted index. Looking beneath those largest-cap companies reveals broader year-to-date weakness in stocks. One way to analyze this factor is to look at the equal-weighted returns of the S&P 500 compared to the market-cap weighted results (the way this index is normally presented).\n\nThe equal-weighted returns for the S&P 500 showed a gain in April of 14.44%, but a year-to-date decline of -16.11%. This is compared to the market-cap weighted numbers of 12.82% and -9.29%, respectively. This reveals that although there was some modest broadening in returns for the month, the largest companies in this index are still driving year-to-date results. This is an important point when analyzing active portfolio managers because they typically build their portfolio on an equal-weighted versus market-cap weighted basis. For example, a portfolio manager might buy a 2% position in 50 stocks to build an equity portfolio and would not typically skew that allocation larger or smaller based on the market cap size of a particular company.\n\nGrowth stocks continued to outpace value stocks on a relative basis rather dramatically for the month and year-to-date. The large-cap and value focused Russell 1000 Value Index advanced 11.24% compared to the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which gained 14.80% in April. Year-to-date results are even more telling with the former index down -18.49% through the first four months of the year and the latter index down a much more modest -1.39%. The theme of large-cap growth companies dominating small and mid-cap companies and the value style has continued into 2020.\n\nInternational equities gained in April as well, but their results lagged U.S. stocks. Emerging market equities, as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, gained 9.16% in April, but were still down -16.60% year-to-date. The MSCI ACWI ex USA Index, a broad measure of international equities, advanced 7.58% for the month, but was off -17.55% year-to-date.\n\nAt various points in March, liquidity dried up in the bond market. Credit spreads widened dramatically during this period and most pockets of fixed income came under pressure outside of U.S. Treasuries as a flight to quality ensued. With monetary operations and massive support from the Federal Reserve in later March and April, liquidity improved, and bond market functioning began to improve.\n\nThe flight-to-quality trade was the clear winner in March as U.S. Treasury yields hit historic lows and Treasury prices rallied. Although U.S. Treasury yields remained near their lows in April, credit spreads narrowed, and most pockets of fixed income enjoyed gains during the month. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury closed March 9th at 0.54%, an all-time low. The yield closed out March at 0.70% and it ended April at 0.64%.\n\nWith this backdrop of narrowing spreads and declining interest rates, fixed income returns were as follows for April: the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index gained 1.78%, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Credit Index advanced 4.58%, and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Index rose 4.51%. Year-to-date, those index results were as follows: a gain of 4.98%, 1.29% and a decline of -8.75%, respectively. Municipal bonds slipped again in April and were also down year-to-date. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 30 Year Treasury index added to its already strong year-to-date gains as it advanced 1.97% in April, putting the gain at 28.29% through the first four months of 2020. The general Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury index gained a more modest 0.64% for the month, but still rose an impressive 8.89% year-to-date.\n\nThe transition from an economy on solid footing to the self-imposed shutdown began to materialize in economic data released in April. Since this information primarily covers March, some economic readings held up, but in most cases, it is really just a matter of time before the economic shutdown shows up broadly throughout the economy.\n\nWe know that economic data in the weeks and months ahead will be bad and we believe the second quarter will bear the brunt of the economic damage. GDP is going to be down significantly in the second quarter and employment will continue to suffer. With many consumers confined to their homes or now unemployed, retail spending will fall dramatically, and we began to see indications of this in the recent data. The advanced reading of first quarter GDP reflected an annualized decline in economic activity of -4.8%. The solid growth of the economy in January and February was not able to withstand the sudden shutdown of many parts of the economy in March as attention turned to slowing the spread of the coronavirus to save lives. We expect second quarter GDP to decline more than 20%.\n\nWe view even the initial attempts by some states to reopen their economies as a positive economic step. We will continue to monitor the re-opening progress and that will in large part determine the type of economic growth we might see later in the year. We fully anticipate some good news and some bad news along the way with some successes and failures. Overall, we believe the third quarter will be a period of transition as people start going back to work in larger numbers and the re-opening process for many businesses gains momentum. The fourth quarter should be a rebound quarter and is likely to exhibit stronger than trend growth as depleted inventories are replenished and pent up demand from consumers is unleashed. We anticipate that 2021 will exhibit above-trend economic growth.\n\nReviewing some of the economic releases in April starts to paint the picture of the magnitude of economic weakness we will likely experience over the next few months. The widely followed Institute for Supply Manufacturing (ISM) Manufacturing Index only modestly declined in March to 49.1 from February's level of 50.1 and it easily surpassed expectations of 44.5. One component of this index, new orders, fell sharply to 42.2 in March from the prior month's mark of 49.8, which provided some insight on what lay ahead. The release of this index on May 1 covering April reflected a much more dramatic decline in manufacturing activity. This reading fell to 41.5, the lowest level in 11 years, despite being ahead of expectations. The Non-Manufacturing Index remained above 50 in March at 52.5, but again, this reading will likely fall dramatically when April data is announced. Recall that 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction for these indices.\n\nThe non-farm payroll decline was dramatic in March, but it only reflected the tip of the iceberg regarding the damage done to the job market in recent weeks. Non-farm payrolls fell by -701,000 and the unemployment rate jumped to 4.4% in March compared to February's job gains of 275,000 and an unemployment rate that stood near a 50-year low at 3.5%. Weekly initial jobless claims readings have been followed closely over the last several weeks and reflect more up-to-date declines in employment. The last six weeks of jobless claims readings through 4/30/20 showed that over 30 million people filed for unemployment benefits during that time and back of the envelope math could put the unemployment rate for April in the neighborhood of 20%. Due to the way the calendar falls this year, the Employment Situation Report for April, which reveals the unemployment rate and non-farm payroll data, will be released on Friday May 8, not Friday May 1. For some perspective on the 30 million job losses over the last six weeks, the number of job gains over the more than ten years following the end of the Great Recession was around 21.5 million and the total number of jobs lost during the credit crisis was around 8.7 million, which saw the unemployment rate peak at 10%.\n\nAs would be expected during this extraordinary time, consumer spending weakened significantly in March. Retail sales, ex. autos and gas, dropped -3.1% during the month and the broader headline retail sales reading fell -8.7%. Personal spending fell -7.5% for the month as personal income dropped by -2.0%.\n\nOther economic releases of note include the Conference Board's Leading Index, which dropped sharply by -6.7% in March compared to the prior month's decline of -0.2%. Housing starts in March fell by -22.3% to an annualized rate of 1.216 million and new home sales dropped to an annualized pace of 627,000, which was a -15.4% decline from the previous month.\n\nThe Federal Reserve continues to support the financial system in full force. Not only has the Fed deployed the playbook from the credit crisis in a matter of weeks, but in many ways, it added plays to the playbook as well. In one of its latest announcements, the Fed indicated that it would provide support to corporate credit, which could include \"Fallen Angels\", which refers to bonds that have been downgraded from BBB (investment grade) to BB (junk bond status) due to this crisis as well as potentially buying investment grade and high yield bond ETFs. This latest facility also included support to municipalities and the Fed recently expanded its Main Street lending facility intended to support small and medium size businesses. The latest fiscal stimulus from Congress and signed by the President focused on additional funds for small businesses and additional support for testing and hospitals.\n\nThese are not exhaustive lists of the actions taken by policymakers. It seems clear that the government is trying to support workers and broad areas of the economy that are being impacted by the shutdown in economic activity caused by the coronavirus. Additionally, the Fed is providing significant amounts of liquidity and support to the financial system so this health care crisis, which has led to an economic crisis, does not develop into a broader financial system crisis.\n\nAlthough it is hard to put a precise number on it, efforts by the Fed plus the fiscal stimulus plans appear to total at least $8 trillion that will be spent to bolster the economy. The United States is about a $20 trillion-dollar economy, so that is a lot of money. It will take time for the stimulus to works its way into the economy and inevitably the naysayers will argue the stimulus is not working. However, we believe that these measures will ultimately work and will have a positive impact on the economy.\n\nWe know these are difficult and challenging times. We also know that we will continue to see bad news in the short-term and we anticipate elevated levels of capital market volatility for the foreseeable future. However, stocks are forward looking, and with the powerful rebound in equities in April, the market appears to be looking beyond the pending weak economic news and poor results from corporate America. While the timing is still uncertain, we remain resolute in our belief that the U.S. economy and corporate America will come through this crisis. We would not bet against the resiliency of the U.S. economy, corporate America and U.S. citizens to fight their way through this challenging period.\n\nWe believe it is imperative for investors to stay focused on their long-term goals and not let short-term swings in the market derail them from their longer-term objectives. This disciplined approach would have served clients very well over the last several weeks as most areas of stocks and bonds improved dramatically from their lowest points in March.\n\nOur top-down, relative strength strategies came into April in a risk-on position and benefited from the strongest monthly performance in the S&P 500 since 1987. The Navigator\u00ae Style Opportunity portfolio was allocated to large-cap growth and the S&P 500 and enjoyed the bounce back from the March lows, as the longstanding trend in growth remained intact.\n\nThe Navigator\u00ae Fixed Income Total Return (FITR) strategy shifted from defensive to risk-on on March 27th, prior to the Federal Reserve's announcement of their support for investment grade and fallen angel debt. High yield enjoyed a huge rally on April 9th when the Fed stated that it would buy corporate bond ETFs, including high yield ETFs.\n\nThe Navigator\u00ae Global Tactical portfolio, which shifts from equity risk-on to risk-off in tandem with the FITR credit-based risk models, came into the year fully invested in equity. It then turned defensive alongside FITR, and went fully back into equity on March 27th, just four days after the low in the S&P 500. The strategy is currently invested in 70% U.S. equity and 30% international equity ETFs.\n\nAs rapid declines accentuate the importance of systematic risk vis-\u00e0-vis non-systematic (individual company) risk, indiscriminate selling provides opportunity for each of our bottom-up equity portfolios. We have spent the last two months determining which companies demonstrate true antifragility. Who has the balance sheet and business model to both shrug off the current recession and resurface during the recovery stronger?\n\nThe Navigator\u00ae High Dividend Equity portfolio focuses on dividend growers, which tend to have more stable businesses and cash flows. In the portfolio, the strongest contributing sectors during the month were Financials, Industrials and Utilities while the detractors were Energy, REITs and Consumer Discretionary.\n\nThe Navigator\u00ae ADR International Equity strategy dramatically reduced its larger-than-typical emerging market weight from 21.6% in January to just 13.7% as slower economic growth typically harms more fragile economies. At month end, we continued to add higher quality companies to the portfolio and as greater visibility regarding economic re-starts progresses, we anticipate continuing to move away from our biggest and safest country and industry holdings such as Japan and Ireland, Healthcare and Technology and moving back to emerging markets and cyclicals.", "uri": "6067551825", "url": "https://www.etftrends.com/etf-strategist-channel/economic-data-reflects-shutdown-but-market-rallies/"}], "6067427445": [398179710, {"sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "published_on": "2020-05-14T13:26:00Z", "name": "Trade of the Day for May 14, 2020: BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BLZ) | InvestorPlace", "dtype": "news", "pk": 398179710, "text": "Through the special vehicles with credit guarantees from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve is making massive buys of US corporate and municipal bonds. It's doing this to both stabilize the bond and credit markets now, as well as working to drive down yields and credit costs for corporations, municipalities and other debt issuers.\n\nThis means both segments and others have a major buyer that underpins prices. Just like after 2007-2008, the Fed kept the bond portfolio and reinvested maturities and interest for most of the following decade. And recently, the new and renewed buying is bulging the Fed's portfolio to nearly $7 trillion and climbing.\n\nThe past has shown how corporates and munis profit with Fed actions. From the end of 2008 through the end of 2019, corporate and municipal bonds generated returns of 103.6% and 72.7%, respectively.\n\nBoth have impressive collections of US corporate bonds, with BlackRock actively managing the actual bonds, while Vanguard does it synthetically following the BlackRock & Barclays Index. And remember, BlackRock is under contract with the Fed to oversee bond buying.\n\nSince late March, both have impressive performance, with VCIT at 9.34% and BTZ at 36.7%.\n\nVCIT yields 3.32% and is a buy in a tax-free account.\n\nBTZ is a closed-end fund and trades at a discount to net asset value (NAV) now of 6.9%, making for an even bigger bargain. Yielding 6.45%, BTZ is a buy in a tax-free account.\n\nI also have a collection of municipal bond funds within the portfolios of Profitable Investing, including the BlackRock Municipal Income Trust II (NYSE:BLE), which is at a discount to NAV. It sports a taxable equivalent yield of around 8% and is a buy in a taxable account.\n\nAnother one of my favorite bond ETFs is the Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:TFI). It yields a taxable equivalent of around 3% and tracks the leading muni index. TFI is a buy in a taxable account.", "uri": "6067427445", "url": "https://investorplace.com/2020/05/buy-what-the-fed-is-buying/"}], "6067325681": [694505086, {"sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "published_on": "2020-05-14T12:27:00Z", "name": "6 Vanguard ETFs to Build a Better Portfolio", "dtype": "news", "pk": 694505086, "text": "If you're searching for funds, look no further than these Vanguard ETF picks\n\nI have been through countless economic and market challenges during my professional career. My first was the stock market crisis of 1987 when I was in London. Then, there was the brief repeat in the fall of 1988.\n\nEach of the economic, market and security challenges has its own root causes and solutions -- and the same is true for the novel coronavirus and resulting lockdowns. But what I do ahead of and during each challenge matters. I provide portfolio allocations that are set up to survive each mess along the way.\n\nNow, my specialties involve economic and market data and developments, and in turn the best individual securities from the stock, bond and other markets to capitalize on those developments for safer growth and income. This is what I showcase in my Profitable Investing -- now past its 30th year of publication.\n\nHowever, I also understand that individual investors need and want exchange-traded funds.\n\nIt may be that portfolios are in smaller sums, or are part of administered qualified retirement accounts. And many of these accounts are domiciled in the major fund companies. The Vanguard Group is one of the largest fund management companies with over $6 trillion in assets under management (AUM). It is one of the leaders in the U.S. market, providing individual investors a wide array of funds including ETFs.\n\nInside my Profitable Investing I have a collection of model mutual fund portfolios including specific ones for individual fund families including Fidelity and Vanguard. I do this to specifically guide subscribers who want or need to stay within fund families.\n\nAnd in all of the mutual fund portfolios, I provide an allocation to specific funds which match up to my main portfolios of individual securities in allocations and strategies.\n\nHere are six specific Vanguard ETFs I'm recommending now:\n\nTo start, I have a current allocation of 56% in stocks, 44% in fixed income -- and included in that 44% is 11% in cash. I know that this allocation is different than the 60/40 balance of stocks to bonds which is typical for many managers. But, I have been a bit more conservative ahead of the current lockdown. I've been looking for opportunities in the bond markets for not just income, but growth.\n\nI'll start with the stock allocations. My continued judgement is that the U.S. remains the prime market of the globe. The U.S. has been hit hard by the lockdowns -- but unlike the rest of the major markets -- the U.S. has the Federal Reserve which is throwing trillions at the economy and markets. And President Donald Trump's administration got Congress to add trillions more.\n\nSo, my allocations are highly focused on the U.S. markets right now. This is different from my decades of global focus while I was in banking and asset management.\n\nThat said, the starting point for Vanguard ETFs is the High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM). This is an indexed ETF focused on U.S.-listed stocks. Its focus group pays higher average dividends than nearly all other stocks in the U.S. market.\n\nThis is my more measured approach to the S&P 500. The higher weightings on dividends provides a lesser risk to downturns as well as volatility.\n\nVYM and S&P 500 Total Return\n\nYou'll note that over the past ten years, the Vanguard ETF has generally provided more consistent total returns including dividend income. And in 2018 during the severe downturn in the S&P 500, the Vanguard ETF held up much better.\n\nBut Vanguard lagged in 2019 while the market drove toward more aggressive stocks -- particularly in the technology sector. My view is that I want to achieve a lower-volatility and lower-risk return over time, and not to have a base which is too heavy on a particular sector.\n\nNext in the stock allocation is real estate investment trusts (REITs). This is done with the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:VNQ). REITs have recently come under fire with lockdowns, but only specific sectors, like retail, are hurting. With low inflation, funding costs are reduced for overall sustained profitability for most in the market.\n\nAnd REITs continue to provide lower risk as they are mainly focused on U.S.-centric assets away from global economic troubles. As noted above, low inflation and largely dependable revenues feeds more valuable dividend income.\n\nVNQ and S&P 500 Total Return\n\nFor the trailing 24 months, the Vanguard REIT ETF was generally outpacing the S&P 500 on a very consistent basis -- especially during some of the selloffs in late 2018. VNQ dropped in March during the market-wide selloff, but it has been returning as more investors eye the fundamentals of the REIT market.\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.7%, the ETF out pays the S&P 500 by a significant margin. With consistency based on real assets and defended dividend income, REITs in this Vanguard ETF are a great way to achieve measured growth with higher income.\n\nThen I move to another traditionally defensive source for growth and income in the U.S. market with utilities. For this I like the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU). Like REITs, U.S. utilities are insulated from global woes and continue to capitalize on the reliability of the country, even during the lockdowns.\n\nThe best utilities are combinations of regulated local services and unregulated wholesale businesses. The combination of dependable revenues, profit margins and added growth and income from additional unregulated operations makes for a great way to generate steady-to-rising income with growth over time.\n\nThe return for VPU over the trailing 24 months is 14.8%, which had been consistently outperforming the S&P 500. And utilities continue to do much better than the general stock market, even during the chaos of this year.\n\nNow I come to the more exciting part of the U.S. market in information technology. Technology has always been a big growth engine for the U.S. economy, and the stocks in this segment reflect optimism for higher returns. I accomplish this allocation with the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).\n\nTechnology is the alchemy of the market. Whether products come from silicon or the ether in the minds of apps and software developers, gold and profits can be achieved in momentous amounts. But not all work, and there are always new products and services making for volatile markets.\n\nSo, while investors need exposure, it should come as part of a broader portfolio.\n\nVGT and S&P 500 Total Return\n\nThe technology market has been a good one, and VGT has turned in a return over just the past trailing five years alone of 143%. This return outpaces the S&P 500 nearly three to one. And technology has become one of the go-to sectors -- continuing to outpace the general market.\n\nFixed income in the U.S. had its selloff in March only to surge back. The U.S. has very low inflation, with very few threats for some time to follow. This has led to lower yields and higher bond prices overall. But there are two sectors which I continue to advocate for investors in corporate bonds and municipal bonds.\n\nCorporate bonds are gaining immense traction with Fed buying, as well as more institutional investors doing their credit analysis of businesses and bolstering their buying resulting in higher bond prices.\n\nMy allocation to this market through Vanguard ETFs is in the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCIT). This ETF has returned 24.4% over the trailing five years years -- significantly outpacing the general U.S. bond market as tracked by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index.\n\nVCIT and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index Total Return\n\nThen for municipal bonds I have the Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:VTEB). Municipal bonds have been gaining like corporates on the growing economy ahead of the lockdowns. Tax revenues are up, aiding credit of issuers. Low inflation aids bonds as well. And issuance has been muted as many issuers have not had the need or the political will to sell more bonds.\n\nVTEB and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index Total Return\n\nVTEB was consistently outperforming the U.S. Aggregate Bond Index over the past trailing five years. That reversed during the March 2020 selloff -- only to sharply reverse for all segments of the bond markets. Municipal bonds have the best credit history of any bond sector besides U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nAnd while some are questioning the budget strife that is and will challenge state and local authorities, Fed lending and municipal bond buying will go far for this market.\n\nNote, even if you invest in qualified investment accounts, I still recommend the tax-free ETF for total return and not just for tax-free income as the municipal bond market is a value right now.", "uri": "6067325681", "url": "https://investorplace.com/2020/05/6-vanguard-etfs-to-build-a-better-portfolio-2/"}], "6067270222": [171162347, {"sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "published_on": "2020-05-14T11:36:00Z", "name": "Some Small Counties Could Take Big Economic Hits From the Coronavirus", "dtype": "news", "pk": 171162347, "text": "Text size\n\nHow much of a threat does the coronavirus pandemic pose to your community?\n\nWhile the worst effects have come in major urban regions, such as metropolitan New York and Detroit, some much smaller areas could be at even greater risk, at least economically.\n\nBarron's recently asked HIP Investor, a sustainability ratings, data, and analytics provider, to come up with a vulnerability ranking. The San Francisco-based organization looked at all 3,142 of the nation's counties and equivalents (such as Louisiana's parishes). HIP gave each a score -- ranging from 0% (excellent) to 100% (terrible) -- that considers factors that help gauge the likelihood of the pandemic striking at the communities, now or in a subsequent wave, and the extent of the possible economic impacts. The study was done before any locked-down state had begun reopening its economy.\n\nThe 10 counties that looked safest were in the West and Midwest -- Minnesota had five on the list -- and, unsurprisingly, have modest populations. The safest larger counties -- those with at least 500,000 residents -- were in the Northeast, the Midwest, and California.\n\nThe worst-rated counties were all in the Southeast and Southwest; five were in Georgia. (See the accompanying tables.) Among the 10 most vulnerable larger counties, half were in Florida; the rest, in five widely dispersed states.\n\nA third of each rating was based on health risks, such as the number of uninsured adults; rates of smoking, flu vaccinations, air pollution, diabetes, and obesity; and the percentage of the population aged 65 and over. Another third came from measures of health-care strength, including the number of hospital beds and primary care physicians per 1,000 people (HIP has data on 6,000 hospitals). The final third looked at transmission risks, such as population density, how quickly each state had instituted a \"stay-at-home\" order, and the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. Those health measures, in turn, can point to a county's economic vulnerability.\n\nSuch information is particularly valuable for investors in municipal bonds issued by counties and public entities within them, such as library or school districts. If its local economy were devastated, an issuer could default.\n\nSays Noah Strouse, the lead impact analyst at HIP Investor: \"Communities with higher Covid-19 vulnerability may be deemed greater credit risks due to more strapped municipal finances, reduced income tax bases, lower educational attainment, and higher unemployment rates. Communities with more power and more financial capacity are better able to withstand any kind of external threat,\" including a pandemic.\n\nThe three counties that the study found most vulnerable to disruption were, in order, Clay in Georgia, Lee in Arkansas, and McIntosh in Oklahoma.\n\nNeither Clay nor McIntosh officials responded to requests for comment from Barron's. However, Lee County treasurer Mark Smith said: \"We're a poor county in a poor state. We're going to take a pretty good hit\" if seriously affected by the virus. But, Smith noted, this hasn't happened. As of May 2, the county had three Covid-19 cases and one death. Still, there are obvious reasons for it to be on HIP's at-risk list.\n\nAn hour southwest of Memphis, Tenn., Lee County has a population of 10,424, at least 1,000 of whom are inmates at a state prison that is a large employer in the area. Any prison or jail is a potential coronavirus hot spot, and one that accounts for almost 10% of an area's population poses a major danger. At Arkansas' Cummins correctional facility, in Lincoln County, less than two hours away, 850 of 1,200 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nIn addition, while Lee County has a cooperative clinic and, a couple of part-time doctors, it has no hospital; the nearest is more than 20 miles outside its boundaries. And poverty -- something Covid-19 seems to prey on -- is widespread. U.S. Census Bureau figures show that 43% of households in the county last year had income below the official federal poverty level, then $25,750 for a family of four. A food pantry from Little Rock recently increased distributions to weekly from monthly. Over the last three census periods, Lee County has lost 20% of its population. \"It will be more this time,\" Smith predicts.\n\nDespite all this, a school district within the county was able to sell construction bonds some years ago. They're unrated by any credit rating firm, and the yield can't be determined since they trade so infrequently, It's been classified by the state as a school district in financial distress. But it's safe to say that their holders would worry if Lee County took a hard blow from Covid-19.\n\nLarger counties with better resources face challenges, too. According to the Brookings Institution, among those with populations of 500,000 to one million, low-wage workers, earning $10.22 an hour, on average, make 35% to 56% of the workforce. These individuals fill jobs that \"are inherently interpersonal in nature (think retail and food service) and are thus uniquely vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19, both as a health and economic matter.\" Another vulnerable group: people 65 or older, particularly those in assisted-living or nursing homes.\n\nGiven Florida's ocean of retirees and huge reliance on low-paying tourism-related jobs, many of its counties look vulnerable. Indeed, five of the top eight spots on HIP's at-risk rankings are in the Sunshine State, which is cautiously reopening its economy after being slow to impose a lockdown\n\nHIP Investor ranks Polk and Volusia Counties, both in Florida, as the most vulnerable larger counties in the nation, followed by Wayne County, Mich.\n\nTodd Bond, director of budget and management services in Polk County, says it is getting a bad rap from HIP. \"We do not feel that any of that [ranking] is accurate,\" he says, noting that the county, which has 700, 000 residents and includes Lakeland and Winter Haven. is less densely populated than other Florida municipalities. As of May 2, it had 523 confirmed coronavirus cases and 26 deaths.\n\n\"Will there be an impact? Yes,\" Bond says. Sales and tourism taxes will be hit: Together, sales and services taxes accounted for about 15% of the county's $893 million in fiscal 2019 revenue \"Our impact on the revenue side will be in the tens of millions of dollars. However, I feel with sound financial practices we'll be able to maintain that. We've had numerous discussions with the management and board about how we deal with some of these sources of revenue.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nVolusia County officials didn't comment. As for Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit, one of the few major U.S. cities ever to go bankrupt, it's already been clobbered by the coronavirus. As of May 2, it had 17,106 cases and 1,884 deaths. Wayne County doesn't anticipate the inability to pay debt service payments, with or without revenue loss replenishment by the federal government,\" a spokesperson said in an email to Barron's.\n\nPinellas County, Fla., home to St. Petersburg and Clearwater, is No. 4 on HIP's at-risk roster. It has 250 skilled nursing facilities, with coronavirus cases in 18 of them. \"We have a pretty vulnerable population,\" says Patricia Gerard, chairman of the county commission. The Florida National Guard is on standby to help with nursing homes and assisted living communities struck by Covid-19.\n\nPinellas County had 766 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 41 Covid-related deaths, as of May 2, and Gerard suspects those numbers are depressed because of sparse testing. \"We're fretting,\" she continues. \"We have no idea what it's going to do to our county budget.\"\n\nHIP's least-vulnerable list is topped, in order, by Wilkin and Big Stone counties in Minnesota and Kiowa County, Colo. Atop its least-at-risk larger-county roster is Dane County, Wis., home to the state capital, Madison; followed by King County, Wash., which includes Seattle; and Worcester County, Mass., site of Worcester, the second-largest city in Massachusetts.\n\nThese counties and the others that fared best in HIP's rankings all have good access to hospitals and other medical services and favorable or average age and income demographics -- big pluses in the uncertainty of the coronavirus era.\n\nWrite to Leslie P.

The effect of these measures in a period of massive downturn will be to further the redistribution of wealth up the income scale.\n\nPowell's remarks effectively poured water on the claim that once lockdowns are lifted, as being demanded by the \"return to work\" advocates, the American economy will immediately snap back in a so-called V-shaped recovery.\n\nHe said the scope and the speed of the downturn was without modern precedent and as a result the job gains in the US economy over the past decade had now been wiped out.\n\nPreviewing Fed data to be released today, he noted that those with the lowest incomes had been the hardest hit. Among people working in February, almost 40 percent were in households making less than $40,000 a year that had lost a job in March. The figures are certain to rise when the data for April are tabulated.\n\nPowell warned that the coronavirus pandemic raised \"longer-term concerns.\"\n\n\"The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy,\" he said. Household and business insolvencies could \"weigh on growth for years to come\" leading to an \"extended period of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes.\"\n\nLoans could provide a bridge across the current crisis but \"the recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time can turn liquidity problems into insolvency problems.\"\n\nSince the crisis began and the plunge in the markets in mid-March all the resources of the Fed have been directed to propping up Wall Street. Its balance sheet has expanded to more than $6 trillion -- an increase of more than $2 trillion in less than two months -- and it is now the guarantor for all sections of the financial markets.\n\nIt has reduced interest rates to zero, and emerged as the chief buyer for Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, securities based on student and credit debt, short-term commercial debt and corporate bonds, including those that have fallen to junk status.\n\nAnd in case of putting the fox in charge of the hen house, the Fed announced this week that its $750 billion corporate bond buying program, financed by the US Treasury, would be organised by BlackRock hedge fund.\n\nBut there are indications of limits to the stimulus for Wall Street that has seen the expansion of some of the wealthiest individuals in the US -- the head of Amazon Jeff Bezos having raked in an additional $24 billion so far.\n\nWall Street indexes have fallen for the past two days amid warnings from a leading hedge fund chief Stan Druckenmiller that the risk-reward calculation was the worst he had ever seen and government stimulus programs would not overcome real economic problems.\n\n\"The consensus out there seems to be: 'Don't worry, the Fed has your back,'\" he told the Economic Club of New York this week. \"There's only one problem with that: our analysis says it's not true.\"\n\nThe economic problems flowing from the pandemic were likely to be long-lasting and would lead to a slew of bankruptcies, he said, and the V-shaped recovery was a \"fantasy.\"\n\nThe scenario put forward by the Fed is that the massive expansion of government debt, potentially to levels even exceeding those reached in World War II will able to be paid for, peacefully and gradually wound down, once a recovery begins.\n\nBut this too is a fantasy. There is no recovery waiting in wings and the ruling classes will seek to put value into the mountain of fictitious capital they have created by extracting it through ever-greater exploitation of the working class.\n\nEven before the pandemic struck, the US and the world economy more broadly was experiencing falling growth rates after a brief upturn in 2017-18.\n\nData from Europe this week point to a massive contraction even if the immediate effects of the virus abate. Statistics from the European Central Bank show a 15 percentage point drop in the proportion of eurozone banks reporting demand from businesses to take out loans for long-term investment in the first quarter of this year.\n\nCapital Economics has forecast that business investment in Europe will fall by 24 percent this year, contributing to a 12 percent contraction in gross domestic product. France has reported the largest ever contraction in fixed capital formation on record while the figure for Spain is at near-record levels. The UN agency UNCTAD has said it expects foreign direct investment to drop by 40 percent this year.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times this week, Angel Gurria, the head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the 33-member group of major economies, said rising debt levels would \"come back to haunt us.\"\n\nHe said that \"right now\" it was necessary to \"throw away the rule book\" but \"in the end there will be consequences.\"\n\nWhat those consequences will be can be seen from a study of economic history. The debt incurred in World War II was able to be run down because of the expansion of the world economy, resting on the strength of US industrial expansion. Today, however, the US is the epicentre of the rot and decay of the world capitalist system and there is no economy or group of economies able to promote global recovery.\n\nConsequently, the situation confronting the working class parallels that which followed World War I when the accumulation of the massive debts to finance it, under conditions of economic recession, resulted in deepening attacks on jobs, wages and social conditions.", "uri": "6066948141", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/05/14/powe-m14.html"}], "p-6066911301": [530285319, {"sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "published_on": "2020-05-14T05:42:00Z", "name": "KBRA Announcement on the Passing of Alan Anders", "dtype": "pr", "pk": 530285319, "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved friend, Alan Anders, who served as the Deputy Director for Financing Policy and Coordination within the New York City Mayor's Office of Management and Budget.

Bond funds own a basket of bond and debt security instruments. Some bond funds invest in a single type of debt security, such as government bonds or municipal bonds, while others invest in different kinds of debt.\n\nInvesting in debt securities carries less risk than stock-based mutual funds, but you still need to determine if bond funds fit your investment goals before putting your money into them. Keep reading to learn more about bond funds and whether they're right for you:\n\nHow Does a Bond Fund Work?What Is the Difference Between a Bond and a Bond Fund?What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Investing in Bond Funds?Types of Bond FundsInvestment-Grade Funds\n\nHigh-Yield Funds\n\nMunicipal Funds\n\nMultisector FundsInternational FundsHow To Choose a Bond FundHow Does a Bond Fund Work?\n\nBond funds work in much the same way as stock-based mutual funds in that they both hold baskets of investments and arrive at values similarly. In a bond fund, the net asset value per share will determine the value of a particular bond. This is calculated by taking the total value of the bonds and subtracting the fund's expenses to determine the net asset value. When you divide the net asset value by the number of shares outstanding, you arrive at the value of the bond fund listed on a per-share basis. Prospective investors should read the bond's prospectus to find information on returns and other important features.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Bond and a Bond Fund?\n\nPut simply, a bond is the debt instrument itself, while bond funds specialize in bond investing.\n\nSave for Your Future Sponsors of\n\nA bond is an individual loan with a promise to return the money upon maturity. A corporation, government, municipality or other entity can issue bonds. Under the agreement, the issuer pays the lender interest at a specified rate over the life of the bond. Once a bond matures, the issuer returns the principal, fulfilling the terms of the agreement.\n\nBond funds are baskets of bonds offered by investment companies. The bonds can vary in type, risk, duration, volatility and return. Also, since a bond fund invests in several different bonds, it won't have a maturity date. When an individual bond matures, the fund will likely invest the principal in a new bond, perpetuating the fund.\n\nRelated: How To Grow Your Money Safely During the Next Downturn\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat Are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Investing in Bond Funds?\n\nLike any investment vehicle, bond funds offer both advantages and disadvantages. Understanding how they can benefit your portfolio or reduce your returns can help you determine if bond funds are suitable investments.\n\nBenefits\n\nAs mentioned before, bond funds are a type of mutual fund. Hence, you pay the expense ratio and professional investors find the bonds that will deliver stable returns at a lower risk.\n\nThe fact that funds own multiple bonds reduces risks. For example, if a municipal bond fund gets hurt when cities default on debt, as some did during the financial crisis, most bond funds will have sufficient diversification to minimize the impact.\n\nAlso, because bond funds don't mature after a specific period of time, you can buy a bond fund at any time at the prevailing price. If it no longer suits your needs, you can also sell the fund at any time as long as the buyer accepts the current market price.\n\nBack to top\n\nDrawbacks\n\nOne potential risk of a bond fund is that your selling price might fall below your original purchase price. In this case, it's possible to lose money in bond funds even though they carry less risk than other types of mutual funds.\n\nAnother drawback of a bond fund is the interest-rate risk. This occurs when a fund invests in low-interest bonds and interest rates then rise. With returns lower than prevailing market rates, the value of bonds typically fall in this situation. Bonds also face prepayment risk, where an issuer pays off a bond early. This can become a factor after interest rates fall and the issuer reissues bonds at a lower interest rate.\n\nKnow: What Are Open-End and Closed-End Funds?\n\nBack to top\n\nTypes of Bond Funds\n\nInvestors can choose from different types of bond funds, which helps you either lessen risk or take on more risk for a higher return. Some funds even allow for tax advantages. Here are a few popular types of bond funds:\n\nInvestment-Grade Funds\n\nInvestment-grade bond funds buy bonds issued by entities with high credit ratings. These bonds carry the lowest credit risk. U.S. Treasury bonds and high-grade corporate bonds fall into this category.\n\nBack to top\n\nHigh-Yield Funds\n\nThese funds buy bonds that offer higher-than-average interest rates. However, they also come with a lower credit rating, increasing the credit risk. Entities with a troubled credit history sometimes issue high-yield bonds.\n\nMunicipal Funds\n\nOther funds buy only \"munis,\" which are bonds issued by state, county and municipal governments. In most cases, these are exempt from federal income tax. Some are also exempt from state and local taxes under certain conditions.\n\nBack to top\n\nMultisector Funds\n\nAs the name implies, these funds invest in multiple sectors of the bond market and typically take on more credit risk. According to Sarah Bush, the North American manager research practice leader at Morningstar, these funds typically invest between one-third and two-thirds of their portfolios in bonds that come in below investment grade.\n\nInternational Funds\n\nInternational funds buy bonds issued by companies or governments outside of the U.S.\n\nThese can offer higher returns and allow investors to profit from currency fluctuations. Just keep in mind that currency movements can also cause losses. Political risks and differing market operations can also add to the uncertainty.\n\nSave for Your Future Sponsors of\n\nDeep Dive: How To Choose the Best Types of Bonds to Buy\n\nBack to top\n\nHow To Choose a Bond Fund\n\nGiven the variety of choices available, choosing the right bond fund can seem just as daunting as trying to understand the funds themselves. As mentioned earlier, your first move should be to research a fund's prospectus to find pertinent information about its investments, expense ratios and rates of return. If you feel you need more help, you can also consult an investment professional to determine if a particular bond fund is right for you.\n\nBack to top\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nWhat Is a Money Market Mutual Fund?What Is a Savings Bond and How Does It Work?Mutual Funds: Everything You Need To KnowETF vs. Mutual Funds: Same Objectives, Different Methods", "uri": "6066732499", "url": "https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/bonds/what-bond-funds/"}], "6066394400": [787751249, {"sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "published_on": "2020-05-13T17:43:00Z", "name": "Bond-financed Florida student housing complex files for bankruptcy", "dtype": "news", "pk": 787751249, "text": "The operator of a student housing complex built for University of Florida students fell into bankruptcy, the latest municipal-bond financed project in fiscal crisis amid the coronavirus fallout.\n\nMidtown Campus Properties LLC sold $78 million in unrated taxable municipal bonds in 2019 for the 310-unit facility in Gainesville, Florida.\n\nThe mixed-use complex, whose website promises an \"elite\" experience for students, was set to include parking spaces for scooters, a resort-style swimming pool, fitness center and arcade with one-bedroom apartments renting for $1,380 per month, bond documents show.\n\nInstead, the operator filed for Chapter 11 last week, less than 16 months after selling bonds.\n\nIt's the latest muni-bond financed project that's fallen into distress after being sold at the height of buyers' interest in risky investments that offered higher yields.\n\nBlackRock Inc. said in a report last week that student dorms are among the areas in the $3.9 trillion state and local government debt market that are vulnerable to the economic impacts of the coronavirus.\n\nThe economic shutdown to stem the spread of the pandemic has pressured states, cities, hospitals and others that routinely borrow in the municipal-bond market.

In a regulatory filing May 11, trustee U.S. Bank said part of an upcoming June debt payment on the muni bonds would be made from reserves.\n\nOscar Roger, chief executive of the Roger Development Group, the Florida real estate company managing the project, said construction will continue on the student housing complex, which is 30% leased and 90% completed.\n\n\"This decision to file bankruptcy was reached after carefully evaluating various options and was caused by several factors including general contractor delays and labor shortages and, most recently, business and University of Florida campus closures from Covid-19,\" Roger said in an emailed statement.\n\nOther student housing projects financed in the muni market are facing financial woes after universities sent students home and refunded their room-and-board costs.\n\nThe Florida dorm project, which was still getting off the ground, reported construction delays from the pandemic, as well as weather and labor issues, according to regulatory filings.\n\nThe unrated bonds were sold to qualified institutional buyers only and priced to yield 7% in 2038.", "uri": "6066382728", "url": "https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/luxury-dorm-financed-municipal-bonds-falls-bankruptcy"}], "6066375257": [881075979, {"sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "published_on": "2020-05-13T17:34:00Z", "name": "BHK: Strong Leveraged Fixed Income CEF With Lower Risk And Lower Return Compared To PIMCO Funds (NYSE:BHK)", "dtype": "news", "pk": 881075979, "text": "Author's note: This article was initially released to CEF/ETF Income Laboratory members on April 21, 2020.\n\nThe BlackRock Core Bond (BHK) is a leveraged fixed-income CEF focusing on investment-grade treasuries, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities, but investing in a wide variety of fixed-income securities. BHK's risk-return profile is somewhere between that of a corporate bond index ETF and that of more aggressive high-yield high-risk fixed-income CEFs, including most comparable PIMCO funds like PCN and PTY.\n\nBHK's underlying holdings perform about as well as those of the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF (VCLT), which, combined with BHK's use of leverage, means that the fund outperforms VCLT during bull markets and in the long term but suffers moderately larger losses during downturns.\n\nBHK focuses on higher-quality lower-risk securities than the vast majority of its peers, including all comparable PIMCO funds, leading to the opposite results compared to above. BHK underperforms most PIMCO funds during bull markets and in the long term but suffers moderately smaller losses during downturns.\n\nBHK is a reasonably strong investment opportunity in the fixed income space and, especially, appropriate for investors looking for slightly stronger returns than those of an index fund or moderately lower risk and fewer losses than its higher-risk peers.\n\nAs a final point, as the article was originally published close to a month ago, I decided to re-check and update a couple of these figures. BHK has continued to outperform, with the fund posting some small gains during these past few weeks, even as the broader bond market posts small losses.\n\nBHK is a leveraged fixed income fund administered by BlackRock, the largest investment managers in the world. BHK itself invests in a wide array of fixed income securities, including treasuries, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other securitized products. The fund's holdings are reasonably well-diversified across sectors, although there is a strong emphasis on (investment-grade) corporate bonds:\n\nAs can be seen above, the fund's investment managers focus on investment-grade securities, which generally compromise at least 75% of the fund's holdings, with smaller investments in non-investment-grade securities. BHK's overall holdings are of reasonably good quality, a benefit for the fund and its shareholders:\n\nBHK's holdings are tilted towards higher-maturity securities, with an effective average duration of 10.77 years.\n\nDue to the above, BHK's interest rate risk is massive, and investors should, in theory, see sizable losses when interest rates increase. In practice, BHK achieved reasonably strong NAV returns when interest rates were increasing, from early 2016 to mid-2019, and the fund's NAV remained stable. Although I can't be completely certain, I believe that BHK might be able to withstand future interest rate hikes without any significant issues as well.\n\nBHK's dividend yield of 5.37% is reasonably good and quite a bit higher than that of VCLT. It is, however, significantly lower than that of most PIMCO corporate bond funds:\n\nBHK's dividend coverage ratio was not easy to calculate. The fund's latest annual report showed a coverage ratio of 85%, although this has increased to about 96% as of April 2020:\n\nThe above figures are, however, calculated using the fund's yield to worst figures, which are exactly what they sound like. It seems quite likely that the fund's distribution coverage is actually higher than implied above, although I'm not certain. In any case, the fund's distribution seems to be mostly covered.\n\nFinally, BHK is a leveraged fund. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses and should lead to stronger long-term shareholder returns, with also stronger losses during downturns. With this in mind, let's take a look at BHK's performance.\n\nBHK's past performance has been reasonably good, with the fund outperforming its index, the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF, by about 1% on most relevant time frames on both a NAV and price basis. The fund has, however, moderately underperformed during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak:\n\n(Source: BHK / VCLT Corporate Websites - chart by author)\n\nOne of the interesting things about BHK is the fact that the fund's price performance is consistently stronger than NAV performance, as can be seen above. I believe this is due to the fact that the fund consistently trades at a small discount, which boosts the fund's dividend yield and hence shareholder returns.\n\nAlthough the fund's current discount is quite small, it is still a net benefit for the fund's shareholders.\n\nAs mentioned previously, BHK has underperformed during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Leveraged funds can sometimes effectively collapse during downturns, be forced to deleverage, and suffer irrecoverable losses, but this doesn't seem to be the case for BHK.\n\nI took a look at the fund's performance during the past financial crisis, and although the fund suffered significant losses during the downturn itself, it swiftly recovered and posted strong returns:\n\nBHK seems to perform like a leveraged VCLT, posting slightly stronger long-term shareholder returns, at the expense of moderately larger portfolio risk and volatility and stronger losses during downturns. This is, in my opinion, a reasonably good investment proposition, but perhaps less appropriate for less risk-averse investors.\n\nFinally, I wanted to compare BHK with some of the PIMCO fixed-income funds. These funds are some of the most popular, best-performing funds for this asset class and have performed exceedingly well since inception. Several of these, including PCI, PCN, PFL, and PCM, are part of CEF/ETF Income Laboratory's portfolios, and I believe that many more are part of subscriber portfolios. From what I've seen, although most of these PIMCO funds invest in the same asset classes as BHK, asset allocations are quite different, so the comparisons are slightly off. PCN's holdings seem the most similar to BHK.\n\nBHK's long-term performance is slightly lower than effectively all PIMCO fixed-income funds, even though BHK focuses on longer-term securities with higher yields. BHK's price performance is comparatively worse, almost certainly due to widening premiums for most PIMCO funds.\n\n(Source: PIMCO Corporate Website - Seeking Alpha - chart by author)\n\nBHK's long-term performance might be inferior to that of the average PIMCO fund, but BHK is also safer and less risky, with significantly fewer losses during market downturns. If you check the figures above, you can see that while BHK has been effectively flat during the current coronavirus outbreak, the average PIMCO fund is down by more than 10% on both a NAV and price basis. It's a staggering difference and one that is great news for BHK and its shareholders.\n\nSomething similar happened during the past financial crisis as well, with BHK experiencing significantly fewer losses than most PIMCO funds. Compare BHK with PCN from 2008 to March 2009, the lowest point during the crisis:\n\nBHK significantly outperformed during the downturn, by between 30% and 40% relative to PCN.\n\nNow, the interesting thing is that PCN then proceeded to recover from these losses and post triple-digit returns in less than a year:\n\nPCN's gains vastly outpaced its losses, and the fund ended up delivering massive market-beating shareholder returns during said crisis:\n\nNow, although I can't be completely certain of why the above happened, I do have an opinion.\n\nPIMCO funds, generally, focus on higher-yield higher-risk securities and are somewhat aggressively managed, at least compared to BHK. PIMCO's managers have, generally, been able to thrive during periods of economic and market stress, by investing highly distressed but materially mispriced securities and profiting from rising NAVs once market conditions stabilize. The strategy seems to have been proven successful in the past, PIMCO's funds are famous and the top performers in their field for a reason, but the focus on higher-risk securities does mean that PIMCO funds underperform during downturns, at least at the beginning.\n\nDue to the above, I do believe that PIMCO funds will probably recover in value during the coming months and will probably end up outperforming relative to BHK once the dust settles. This is, of course, speculative on my part and strongly dependent on management execution and decisions.\n\nBHK's risk-return profile is somewhere between a corporate bond index ETF and the average corporate bond PIMCO fund. BHK is more profitable and riskier than VCLT but less profitable and safer than most comparable PIMCO funds.\n\nDue to the above and taking into consideration BHK's past performance, I believe that the fund is a good investment opportunity and, particularly, appropriate for investors looking for a less volatile alternative to these PIMCO funds.\n\nThanks for reading!

Not a subscriber? Start your subscription here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve rolled out the first stage of its corporate bond-buying program Tuesday, stepping into totally uncharted territory: buying longer-dated company debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it would start buying exchange traded funds, which trade like stocks but have broad exposure to corporate bonds. It will then begin to buy bonds directly \"in the near future,\" according to a Monday night release.\n\nEven before buying a single bond, the Fed managed to achieve its primary goal: restarting the frozen corporate debt market. It first announced that it would set up the programs March 23, and the mere promise of a backstop revived the market, allowing companies to issue debt to raise needed cash amid the coronavirus economic downturn.\n\nOnce they are fully up and running, the Fed's programs will buy both newly issued debt on the primary market and debt that is already being traded on a secondary market. The programs were expanded April 9 to include some junk bonds.\n\nApril was a record month for U.S. investment-grade bond sales, which totaled more than $300 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The market for shakier bonds has also been revived.\n\n\"A lot of the heavy lifting has already been done,\" Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said before the announcement.\n\nThe Fed is first buying ETFs -- mostly investment-grade but some high-yield -- because they \"serve as an efficient mechanism to access the corporate bond market\" as the direct programs get up and running, it said in a footnote Monday.\n\nBlackRock Inc., which is the largest issuer of ETFs, will run the program for at least its first three months. The New York Fed had previously announced that it had picked the firm's advisory business to handle the purchases based on technical know-how. According to the Fed's investment management agreement, BlackRock will not charge asset management fees on ETFs in the program, and will pay back the value of other fees it earns on its own ETFs.\n\nNevertheless, the firm is a beneficiary of the program as a market backstop. BlackRock's high-yield fund, HYG, bounced on the initial news of the corporate bond facility and took another leg up after the Fed expanded program criteria in April to include riskier debt. Some of those gains have since faded, but it is a sign that in improving broader market functioning, the Fed's program announcement helped the fund.\n\nIt is unclear how extensively the two central bank programs will be used. The pricing and terms are such that the direct-buying facility in particular may not see huge use, economists and strategists said. Instead, it will serve as a kind of safety blanket assuring investors that the Fed will step in if markets become volatile.\n\nIn particular, companies must demonstrate that they were not able to access credit from a bank or on the open market at reasonable terms before using the primary market program, which could create a stigma.\n\n\"There's a good chance the primary facility may not be used,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg at TD Securities in New York. \"It's a good outcome -- if they intend to be a market backstop, it's actually OK.\"\n\nThe mere announcement of the programs has already enabled a wave of new corporate bond issuance. Boeing raised $25 billion in a late-April bond sale. Outstanding bonds have also recovered, and as the Fed pledged to buy debt from recently downgraded companies, it lifted prices and reduced rates on debt that had been issued by so-called \"fallen angels,\" including Ford Motor.\n\nWhen it comes to the secondary-market program, which focuses on already-issued bonds, the Fed said in its investment management agreement released Monday that purchases would vary based on market conditions, with a goal of \"reducing the broad-based deterioration of liquidity seen in March 2020 to levels that correspond more closely to prevailing economic conditions\" that will eventually transition into \"a reduced, steady pace\" of buying to maintain market functioning.\n\nGiven that secondary market functioning has largely returned to normal, that could be a quick process.\n\nWhile the program has been cheered by many on Wall Street for reinvigorating credit markets, there are critics of the central bank's actions to shore up the big companies that tap corporate debt markets.\n\nThe anti-monopoly group American Economic Liberties Project has been characterizing the corporate program as a \"bailout\" for companies like Boeing, which has managed to issue debt since the Fed announced that the program was coming and restored market functioning.\n\nSome analysts said the idea that helping larger companies is a problem is misplaced.\n\n\"This is all about, in the end, supporting employment,\" said Steven Friedman, a former New York Fed official who is now senior macroeconomist at the investment management firm MacKay Shields. \"The companies that employ people need access to credit\" and \"it's really about the survivability of firms,\" he said.\n\nThe Fed has announced initiatives to help smaller companies and governments, but those are also never-before-attempted and have yet to get up and running. It has set out plans for a \"Main Street\" lending program for mid-size companies and has said it will buy municipal bonds to boost states and large cities and counties.\n\nThis facility is the first Fed emergency lending program backed by a recent congressional appropriation to begin operating. Lawmakers earmarked $454 billion to provide insurance against losses to the Fed programs, and some have been eager to see it used.\n\nRep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., sent the Fed and Treasury a letter last week asking why they had not tapped the money yet.\n\nThe Treasury has earmarked $75 billion in total funding for the corporate bond-buying program, with $25 billion of that meant to support buying bonds through the secondary market program and $50 billion meant to back up direct bond purchases.\n\nThat funding could support $750 billion in total purchases, although it may not use that capacity.\n\n\"Companies are out there financing, they're out there raising liquidity,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at his April 29 news conference. \"The ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that it really gets the market functioning again. Of course we have to follow through, though.\"", "uri": "6066356667", "url": "https://finance-commerce.com/2020/05/fed-makes-initial-purchases-in-its-first-corporate-debt-buying-program/"}], "6066273133": [617860060, {"sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "published_on": "2020-05-13T15:57:00Z", "name": "Powell: Fed Not Looking at Negative Rates", "dtype": "news", "pk": 617860060, "text": "(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a sober review of where the U.S. economy stands on the cusp of its reopening, said on Wednesday the country could face an \"extended period\" of weak growth and stagnant incomes, pledged to use more Fed power as needed, and issued a call for more fiscal spending.\n\nIn a Webcast Question & Answer hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Powell said the Fed's view on negative interest rates has not changed and it is not something the policy-setting committee is looking at.\n\nStory:\n\nMARKET REACTION:\n\nSTOCKS: S&P 500 opened lower after futures erased losses, last off 0.68%\n\nBONDS: U.S. Treasury yields see sawed in a narrow range, briefling firming after Powell threw cold water on negative rates; 2s <US2YT=RR> last at 0.1569%; 10s <US10YT=RR> at 0.6573%\n\nFOREX: The U.S. dollar index little changed about 0.15% lower\n\nCOMMENTS:\n\nKARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CAMBRIDGE GLOBAL PAYMENTS, TORONTO\n\n\"In saying that the FOMC's position 'has not changed, this is not something we're looking at,' Mr. Powell clearly shelved the prospect of negative rates for now.

What It Could Mean for Your Fund.", "dtype": "news", "pk": 789917487, "text": "Text size\n\nIn the midst of the coronavirus crisis, news in the money management business that would normally be considered startling largely goes virtually unnoticed. Consider that TIAA, the parent company of the $1 trillion Nuveen, announced on May 11 that it is offering a buyout package to 75% of its U.S. employees.\n\nAbout half of Nuveen's assets are in bond funds or institutional accounts, many of which are highly specialized, niche municipal bond products such as the $18 billion Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond (ticker: NHMAX) mutual fund. TIAA hasn't revealed whether such funds will be affected by the buyout, but the news is troubling to say the least. Nuveen manages $243 billion in 145 mutual funds and ETFs, including those of its affiliate TIAA Investments, according to Morningstar Direct. TIAA acquired Nuveen in 2014, and eventually rebranded its asset management unit as Nuveen. Though not without its struggles, TIAA, lead by chief Roger Ferguson, is a widely respected, low-cost and top-performing asset manager and steward of pensions for teachers and hospital workers.\n\n\"There's a lot of intellectual property, a lot of expertise from the stock and bond selection efforts, that could walk out the door,\" says Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's head of Mutual Fund and ETF Research. \"There's likely to be some portfolio managers and some senior analysts that will [leave].\" CFRA incorporates manager tenure into its mutual fund ratings and will ultimately downgrade some funds if this happens as a new manager makes a fund's \"track record less meaningful,\" he says. It's also possible funds could be merged into other funds as a result \"so investors end up with a strategy that's different than they might have expected with different investment criteria and different holdings. So, it's a concern to us.\"\n\nIt makes sense that the most-senior personnel might be the ones to walk, as they are closest to retirement, and have the highest salaries, enabling TIAA to more easily cut costs. More-senior people will also receive the best benefits from the buyout program, which offers 45 to 91 weeks' salary, depending on length of service and salary; 100% of last year's bonus; and six months of outplacement assistance. Manager John Miller of Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond, for instance, has been running that fund since 2000.\n\nA TIAA spokesperson said in an email that while the buyout program is being offered \"to most employees across our global enterprise (TIAA, TIAA Bank, and Nuveen), we expect only 5% to 7% of eligible employees to participate\" and that portfolio managers and analysts have long-term incentive plans and non-compete provisions in their contracts should they leave. Also, the spokesperson said before the program began Nuveen had \"one of the asset management industry's lowest rates of departure for investment personnel.\"\n\nBut knowing who is departing is essential, especially if 2020's volatile market continues.\n\nMunicipal bonds tend to be one of the least liquid asset classes, as there are many thousands of tiny issuers with bonds that trade infrequently. This is especially so in the high yield muni bond space. Forced selling from shareholder redemptions can have a negative impact on such funds. Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond was down 22% in the month of March until the market's bottom on March 23, before the government announced its bond bailout. According to Morningstar analyst Brian Moriarty, part of the reason for the decline was that the fund's \"stake in unrated credits, which tend to be smaller and less liquid, has consistently been far larger than its typical peer and sat at around 51% of the portfolio at the end of February versus the typical peer's 26% allocation.\"\n\nNow consider what will happen to this and Nuveen's other muni bond funds if they lose managerial and analytical staff and sophisticated investors start to sell the funds as a result. \"Nuveen is often focused on some of the less liquid parts of the market where they have an advantage from the security selection standpoint,\" Rosenbluth says. \"If Nuveen has to sell to meet redemptions, that could cause additional challenges because getting out of those securities at a fair price could be a problem.\"\n\nManager experience should always be a factor in evaluating a fund, but it's not the only factor. Nuveen has a deep bench of experience, and it will be a while -- weeks or months -- before it's clear which funds will see personnel depart. It's far too soon to consider selling, especially given the likely tax consequences.

Stocks fell sharply at the open, led by the Dow Jones.\n\n\"While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,\" Powell said in a speech at a Peterson Institute for International Economics online forum.\n\nPowell highlighted the disproportionate hit to lower-income workers and raised concern about a drawn-out recovery. Although the outlook will depend on unknowns, like whether there are more outbreaks, Powell said policymakers need to be prepared for the worst.\n\nDow Jones futures, up more than 100 points before Powell's speech, were down sharply as trading began. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also reversed lower.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 0.64%.\n\nThe bottom for the Dow Jones and broader stock market came on March 23, the day the Federal Reserve launched unlimited QE. While the $2 trillion federal aid package also played a role in shifting sentiment, \"Don't fight the Fed\" has proved to be good advice.\n\nAs Congress gets off to a bumpy start down the road to another potentially massive coronavirus stimulus package, Powell's speech shifted the focus to Federal Reserve policy.\n\nThe Fed has already committed an unprecedented amount of support to keep the U.S. economy from imploding due to the coronavirus shutdown. Yet, after the Fed stood pat at its April 29 meeting, Powell provided assurance that policymakers would continue to act \"forcefully, proactively and aggressively\" to try to assure a robust recovery.\n\nUnless the U.S. economy's recovery from the coronavirus crash suprises on the upside, Wall Street may grow impatient to hear what other measures Powell may roll out.\n\nIn March, without waiting for its regularly scheduled meeting, the Federal Reserve slashed rates close to zero in two steps, launched unlimited quantitative easing and scooped up $2.5 trillion in assets, primarily Treasuries and mortgage securities.\n\nUnder Fed chief Powell, the central bank has announced a series of programs that could see it provide $4 trillion in funding to businesses hurt by the coronavirus, as well as states and municipalities. The Cares Act coronavirus rescue set aside $454 billion for the Treasury Department to backstop the programs, with the Fed supplying the bulk of the liquidity.\n\nOne of those new programs focused on buying corporate bond ETFs began making purchases on Tuesday.\n\nOther programs focused on buying corporate bonds in the secondary market, buying municipal bonds and lending money to small and midsize business have yet to launch.\n\nWhile those credit programs have been ramping up, Fed quantitative easing purchases of Treasuries and mortgage securities have slowed dramatically. At the peak in late March, the Fed was buying $75 billion in Treasuries and $50 billion in mortgage securities per session. That has plunged by more than 90% to a combined $12 billion in daily purchases.\n\nYet it remains to be seen how effective the Fed credit programs will be and how much demand there will be. Powell noted in his April 29 press conference that, unlike the Paycheck Protection Program created by Congress to fund small business, the Fed will make loans, not grants.\n\nThe Fed's April 29 statement said the health crisis will weigh heavily in the near term and \"poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\"\n\nThe Fed said it will keep rates in the 0%-0.25% range until the \"economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\"\n\nPowell didn't provide much more clarity in his post-meeting press conference, saying it will \"take some time\" to reach \"anything that resembles maximum employment.\"\n\nSome on Wall Street think the Fed should offer a clearer timeline, such as precluding rate hikes until the unemployment rate falls to 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, other economists are looking for clarity on how the Fed will keep long-term Treasury yields low, even as the federal deficit balloons to about $4 trillion.\n\nWall Street economists think the answer may be something the Federal Reserve last tried in the 1940s: yield curve control.\n\n\"When the economy starts to recover with very large federal debt issuance, there is some risk of an unwelcome jump in Treasury yields,\" wrote Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, ahead of the Fed's April meeting. \"Ultimately we think the FOMC will adopt some form of yield curve control,\" predicting a June announcement.\n\nYield curve control could be a way for the Fed to conserve its balance-sheet ammunition. One way it might work is for the Fed to set interest rates, rather than market forces, up to perhaps two-year Treasuries. While longer-term yields might still float, the Fed could use all of its QE power at the longer end of the Treasury curve to hold rates in check.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nStock Market Today: Is Rally Disconnected From Economy?\n\nIBD Stock Of The Day: Neurocrine Sets Up After Q1 Report\n\nThe Big Picture: Bears Rule Session, But Here's Why Uptrend Is Intact\n\nIBD 50 Stocks To Watch: This Pharma Leader Is Breaking Out Today", "uri": "6066129533", "url": "https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-chair-jerome-powell-whets-appetite-for-more-action-dow-jones/"}], "6066124513": [329983331, {"sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "published_on": "2020-05-13T13:42:00Z", "name": "Powell: Fed not looking at negative rates", "dtype": "news", "pk": 329983331, "text": "(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in a sober review of where the U.S. economy stands on the cusp of its reopening, said on Wednesday the country could face an \"extended period\" of weak growth and stagnant incomes, pledged to use more Fed power as needed, and issued a call for more fiscal spending.\n\nIn a Webcast Question & Answer hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Powell said the Fed's view on negative interest rates has not changed and it is not something the policy-setting committee is looking at.\n\nBONDS: U.S. Treasury yields see sawed in a narrow range, briefling firming after Powell threw cold water on negative rates; 2s US2YT=RR last at 0.1569%; 10s US10YT=RR at 0.6573%\n\nFOREX: The U.S. dollar index .DXY little changed about 0.15% lower\n\nKARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CAMBRIDGE GLOBAL PAYMENTS, TORONTO\n\n\"In saying that the FOMC's position 'has not changed, this is not something we're looking at,' Mr. Powell clearly shelved the prospect of negative rates for now.

The lights went out on the economy in mid-March and the blowback since then has been stunning. More than 30 million Americans, or roughly 20 per cent of the workforce, have filed for unemployment benefits. The April jobs report was the single worst monthly showing on record: in excess of 20 million jobs have been eliminated, including 6.4 million \"Accommodations and Food Service\" jobs, wiping out 45 per cent of that sector.\n\nConsumer spending suffered a similar slide. Outlays on travel, both international and domestic, plunged more than 60 per cent in Q1, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Movies and live entertainment deteriorated similarly, cratering 62 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively. Clothing stores witnessed a 50 per cent pullback in retail activity in March, according to the US Census Bureau. But grocery store registers rang up 27 per cent higher sales vs February.\n\nCommodity prices - which are real-time indicators of global economic activity - also retrenched. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has slid 60 per cent to date, after spending a couple of ugly days in April in negative territory for the first time in history. US electricity consumption is 8.6 per cent lower year over year, roughly in tandem with economists' forecasts for our nation's growth outlook.\n\nSince hitting its low on March 23, about one week after the national lockdown took effect, US equity markets have surged nearly 30 per cent. Why, in the face of the toll taken on our nation in both human and economic terms, are equity markets trending higher? Last Friday's 455-point Dow rally, on the same day as the devastating jobs report was released, exemplified this divergence between Wall Street and Main Street.\n\nAccommodative monetary policy - central banks' willingness to provide liquidity through bond purchases - represents a good portion of the rally's fuel. The Federal Reserve is taking a page from former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's \"whatever it takes\" playbook: Chairman Powell's monetary pledges currently amount to about 30 per cent of US GDP. Other central banks around the world aren't far behind. Much of the divergence in equity market performance this year can be explained by the degree of central bank intervention in respective countries. China is an outlier in this regard, probably because they're further along their economic road to recovery. Central banks' liquidity largess has eased capital market concerns. However, monetary stimulus benefits large, mostly public, companies with access to capital markets, leaving smaller, Main Street businesses to rely on Congress's awkwardly administered lending programs. While small businesses struggle to access relief funds, more than $68 billion of corporate bonds were issued in Q1, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has bifurcated the corporate world into those firms that will survive the lockdown, and those that won't. Investors are reevaluating their holdings, making the distinction between companies that have temporary liquidity challenges and companies that have serious solvency concerns. Access to capital will alleviate liquidity problems, but current circumstances punish insolvency. Balance sheet quality is paramount in today's uncertainty, as credit quality explains a large share of equity market divergences.\n\nThe last, and least understood, source of divergence is the mechanism by which stock prices are derived. In its purest sense, a stock's price is the present value of all future cash flows, assuming the stock will be held indefinitely. Here is a simple example: Suppose a company pays out its entire 2020 earnings stream of $4/share as a dividend to shareholders and grows earnings at 2 per cent annually thereafter. Using a 5 per cent discount rate, the share price would be $100. Suddenly, a global pandemic shutdown wipes away 2020 and 2021 earnings. Although earnings resume in 2022, they are at 2020 levels, in essence meaning the company has been in a coma for two years. Despite this setback, the present value of the revised cash flow stream - using the same 5 per cent discount rate but with an earnings stream that is two years shorter - declines by only 11 per cent, meaning the share is still worth $89. Investing is a long-term endeavor; though missing two years of cash flow is devastating while you're living through it, any given year represents just a small fraction of a company's equity value.\n\nNotwithstanding the positive factors, we see several risks to equities. The first is the path of the virus. COVID-19 is an insidious enemy that won't disappear until most of the world's population is immune either through exposure or immunization. Social distancing can slow the infection rate, but it won't eradicate the virus's threat. Increased interactions as lawmakers ease stay-at-home orders could usher in a second wave of infections, prompting expanded lockdowns and renewed social distancing. We do not believe equity markets are pricing in this realistic threat which has the potential to push prices lower, although not necessarily to their March 23 low.\n\nThe second risk, although longer-term in nature, is related to the policy response to the crisis. Unprecedented government support is projected to push government debt and deficits to their highest levels relative to GDP since World War II. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) expects the federal debt held by the public will exceed the size of the economy by the end of this year; by 2023 it will eclipse the record set after World War II. Higher tax rates will surely follow. Corporate tax collection as a share of GDP has been steadily declining. By the end of 2019 it sat at 1.1 per cent, nearing its lowest point in history. The last time government debt exceeded the size of the economy, the corporate tax collected represented 6.9% of GDP. Higher corporate taxes would undoubtedly have an impact on share prices.\n\nInvestment sensibility during this period of uncertainty should mirror our own personal sensibility: maintain as much as possible while avoiding unnecessary risks. Most quality companies, with the help of central bank liquidity, will likely reemerge from the lockdown. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for their highly leveraged, lower-quality counterparts. We suggest investors maintain their long-term equity allocation target, but emphasize markets, sectors and companies that are insulated from the vagaries of COVID-19.\n\nWe also know that as the world economy attempts to reopen, the course of the pathogen will remain uncertain. As a result, business leaders, lawmakers and investors must prepare to balance two risk scenarios. In the first, an overly enthusiastic population, tired of isolation, reengages too quickly and triggers a reescalation of infections. In the second, a general unwillingness of fearful consumers or workers to engage in a reopened economy turns what was expected to be a \"U-shaped\" recovery into an \"L-shaped\" malaise. Either scenario would pose near-term risks for equity markets, although economically sensitive and highly leveraged stocks would be the ones most at risk.\n\nLonger term, we believe investors should plan for higher taxes as lawmakers grapple with government debt levels not seen in a generation. While it's too early to tell where policymakers will look to raise revenue, corporate and personal income tax rates are likely candidates. This suggests carefully selected, intermediate-term municipal bonds would be a good place for investors to generate income, as the value of their tax exemption increases with higher marginal tax rates. Growth-oriented equities offer the best opportunity in navigating a higher tax environment, since a greater share of their return is derived by capital appreciation and not income-generating dividends.\n\nCOVID-19 reminds us that near-term investment risks abound. However, equity investing requires a longer-term time horizon to ensure success. We can't promise that reopening the economy won't suffer setbacks, but we're confident that, several years from now, COVID-19 will be a bad memory that shaped public policy and business strategy and inspired movies, songs and books.

Instead, the operator filed for Chapter 11 last week, less than 16 months after selling bonds.\n\nIt's the latest muni-bond financed project that's fallen into distress after being sold at the height of buyers' interest in risky investments that offered higher yields. BlackRock Inc. said in a report last week that student dorms are among the areas in the $3.9 trillion state and local debt market that are vulnerable due to the economic impacts of the coronavirus.\n\nThe economic shutdown to stem the spread of the pandemic has pressured states, cities, hospitals and others that routinely borrow in the municipal-bond market. State and local bonds have lost 0.6% this year, headed for their first loss since 2013, according to the Bloomberg Barclays index. But the high-yield muni market, where the riskiest projects raise funds, has been particularly hard hit. High-yield munis have lost 9% this year, on track for their biggest drop since 2008.\n\nMidtown Campus Properties LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 8 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida, listing liabilities between $50 million and $100 million.

The announcement alone had soothed the market.\n\nThe Federal Reserve rolled out the first stage of its corporate bond buying program on Tuesday, stepping into totally uncharted territory: buying longer-dated company debt.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it would start buying exchange traded funds, which trade like stocks but have broad exposure to corporate bonds. It will then begin to buy bonds directly \"in the near future,\" according to a Monday night release.\n\nEven before buying a single bond, the Fed managed to achieve its primary goal: restarting the frozen corporate debt market. It first announced that it would set up the programs on March 23, and the mere promise of a backstop revived the market, allowing companies to issue debt to raise needed cash amid the coronavirus economic downturn.\n\nOnce they are fully up and running, the Fed's programs will buy both newly issued debt on the primary market and debt that is already being traded on a secondary market. The programs were expanded on April 9 to include some junk bonds.\n\nApril was a record month for United States investment-grade bond sales, which totaled more than $300 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The market for shakier bonds has also been revived.\n\n\"A lot of the heavy lifting has already been done,\" Subadra Rajappa, head of United States rates strategy at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said before the announcement.\n\nThe Fed is first buying E.T.F.s -- mostly investment-grade but some high-yield -- because they \"serve as an efficient mechanism to access the corporate bond market\" as the direct programs get up and running, it said in a footnote on Monday.\n\nBlackRock Inc., which is the largest issuer of E.T.F.s, will run the program for at least its first three months. The New York Fed had previously announced that it had picked the firm's advisory business to handle the purchases based on technical know-how. According to the Fed's investment management agreement, BlackRock will not charge asset management fees on E.T.F.s in the program, and will pay back the value of other fees it earns on its own E.T.F.s.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy Saudi Aramco reports shrinking profit as oil prices fall.

See more updates Updated 58m ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nNevertheless, the firm is a beneficiary of the program as a market backstop. BlackRock's high-yield fund, HYG, bounced on the initial news of the corporate bond facility and took another leg up after the Fed expanded program criteria in April to include riskier debt. Some of those gains have since faded, but it is a sign that in improving broader market functioning, the Fed's program announcement helped the fund.\n\nIt is unclear how extensively the two central bank programs will be used. The pricing and terms are such that the direct-buying facility in particular may not see huge use, economists and strategists said. Instead, it will serve as a kind of safety blanket assuring investors that the Fed will step in if markets become volatile.\n\nIn particular, companies must demonstrate that they were not able to access credit from a bank or on the open market at reasonable terms before using the primary market program, which could create a stigma.\n\n\"There's a good chance the primary facility may not be used,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg at TD Securities in New York. \"It's a good outcome -- if they intend to be a market backstop, it's actually OK.\"\n\nThe mere announcement of the programs has already enabled a wave of new corporate bond issuance. Boeing raised $25 billion in a late-April bond sale. Outstanding bonds have also recovered, and as the Fed pledged to buy debt from recently downgraded companies, it lifted prices and reduced rates on debt that had been issued by so-called \"fallen angels,\" including Ford Motor.\n\nWhen it comes to the secondary-market program, which focuses on already-issued bonds, the Fed said in its investment management agreement released Monday that purchases would vary based on market conditions, with a goal of \"reducing the broad-based deterioration of liquidity seen in March 2020 to levels that correspond more closely to prevailing economic conditions\" that will eventually transition into \"a reduced, steady pace\" of buying to maintain market functioning.\n\nGiven that secondary market functioning has largely returned to normal, that could be a quick process.\n\nWhile the program has been cheered by many on Wall Street for reinvigorating credit markets, there are critics of the central bank's actions to shore up the big companies that tap corporate debt markets.\n\nThe antimonopoly group American Economic Liberties Project has been characterizing the corporate program as a \"bailout\" for companies like Boeing, which has managed to issue debt since the Fed announced that the program was coming and restored market functioning.\n\nSome analysts said the idea that helping larger companies is a problem is misplaced.\n\n\"This is all about, in the end, supporting employment,\" said Steven Friedman, a former New York Fed economist now at the investment management firm MacKay Shields. \"The companies that employ people need access to credit\" and \"it's really about the survivability of firms,\" he said.\n\nThe Fed has announced initiatives to help smaller companies and governments, but those are also never-before-attempted and have yet to get up and running. It has set out plans for a \"Main Street\" lending program for midsize companies, and has said it will buy municipal bonds to boost states and large cities and counties.\n\nThis facility is the first Fed emergency lending program backed by a recent congressional appropriation to begin operating. Lawmakers earmarked $454 billion to provide insurance against losses to the Fed programs, and some have been eager to see it used.\n\nRepresentative Katie Porter, a Democrat from California, sent the Fed and Treasury a letter last week asking why they had not tapped the money yet.\n\nThe Treasury has earmarked $75 billion in total funding for the corporate bond-buying program, with $25 billion of that meant to support bond-buying through the secondary market program and $50 billion meant to back up direct bond purchases.\n\nThat funding could support $750 billion in total purchases, though it may not use that capacity.\n\n\"Companies are out there financing, they're out there raising liquidity,\" Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said at his April 29 news conference. \"The ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that it really gets the market functioning again.

It is a year of survival. Businesses and economies can be dealt with, only if the people dealing with them, are still alive to deal with them.\n\nThe easiest answer to \"How has Covid-19 affected the world,?\" is, the social aspect to it. Every human being on earth, after almost 103 years since the last pandemic, agrees that we humans are all on the same page, at least socially. We are all affected. Easter came and went, churches were empty.\n\nRamadan is here, mosques are empty. Iftars are without friends and family. The Vatican is closed and the Kaaba is without millions submitting to Allah's will. Factories are empty. Malls have neither mature shoppers roaming around or charged up teenagers window shopping. Roads are almost empty and so are the fuel tanks.\n\nOh, did I say fuel? Never before has the world seen such havoc in the oil markets where the May WTI (West Texas Intermediate) oil contracts went into negative territory. What does a contract going negative mean anyway? What it means is that the seller has possession of the oil, let's say on a tanker on the port, but the buyer has run out storage facilities.\n\nRead more: Locking down the Essentials: Whilst Hoping to Survive\n\nThe buyer is less at risk than the seller because if the seller does not empty the vessel, he is at risk of paying charges that can come into thousands of dollars a day. Perhaps even a higher amount based on the size of the vessel, Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC), or the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC), representing two different sizes, both in millions of barrels on-board.\n\nSo the seller is more eager to have the oil taken away from his hands than the buyer is willing to take it away. The seller entices the buyer by offering him money to take the delivery of the contract. Take the oil from me, and I will pay you an extra amount, along with a free contract. Imagine the state of panic in the oil markets, when such deals are offered.\n\nIn the past two months alone, the oil marketing and exploration companies have absorbed more than $350 billion losses. The word \"billion\" has become so widely used that even I, as an investment banker, wonder what this virus has brought upon us, we are comparing trillions being spent by countries, which was unheard of just five months ago!\n\nLet us talk about why billions have less value these days. The USA has spent two trillion dollars, so far, trying to stabilize its economy. But it has not succeeded. Just two months ago, the United States only had 3.2 million people who had filed for jobless benefits.\n\nEight weeks later, the number has crossed 31 million individuals. These are some serious numbers by any standards. The number of lost jobs, recently, supersedes the number of jobs that had been created in the United States after the 2008 recession.\n\nThe word \"billion\" has become so widely used that even I, as an investment banker, wonder what this virus has brought upon us, we are comparing trillions being spent by countries, which was unheard of just five months ago!\n\nMunicipal Bond markets in America, with a size of 3.8 trillion dollars, are in serious threat of a default. Municipal bonds feed the local economies in the country. Schools, hospitals, transportation, local employees' pension funds, roads, and many others. The state and municipal governments have to take care of these utilities.\n\nFor this purpose, they issue bonds. These bonds are paid back through locally collected taxes and the sales tax on items sold. With malls closed, shops closed, businesses closed, local governments have no revenue streams to depend on, and no reserves to fall back on. American state and local governments only keep, historically, 7.5 percent of their total budgets as rainy day funds.\n\nMeaning that less than a months' expense is covered through their savings. And Covid-19 is way past the one month mark. Bonds mature every month with different maturity dates. They have to be paid back. If the payments on the bonds are defaulted or even delayed, the ratings on the bonds drop like a rock through a canyon. Low ratings mean no new funds coming in - a disaster for these small governments.\n\nAmerica has a $15 trillion-plus mortgage market including home mortgages, business buildings, farms, and other loans, According to the Federal Reserve, 32 percent of the mortgage market is coming close to the threat of falling under the forbearance category. A step before the foreclosure category. Imagine 5 trillion dollars being defaulted upon. It would create a domino effect that will make the 2008 financial crisis look like a walk in the park.\n\nRead more: Corona Entering Pakistan: The Lack of Conformity\n\nThe corporate sector is not lagging far behind when it comes to facing a disaster. Apple is losing $1 billion a day in revenue due to its store closures. The airline sector has faced over $200 billion in losses and these pile up every hour. Hotels are about to declare bankruptcies unless protected by the government through bailouts.\n\nAmerica has had the longest economic expansion in its history for 11 years in a row. The stock market grew, corporations became trillion-dollar companies, GDP grew, employment was at its peak, and the future looked like it was going to remain that way. And 11 years of progress has crashed in less than 11 weeks. Never before has any economy seen such a fiasco. Europe is not lagging far behind.\n\nIf any European thinks that the fiasco ends across the Atlantic and will not reach the shores of Europe, well, too late. It already has. EU has already doled out over $2.4 trillion to save the economies of its union.\n\nGermany, the strongest of the European economy, is facing a problem it has not witnessed even during all the wars it has handled. Germany has always been considered a strong economy with no fanfare but a solid record. That record has come crashing down last week.\n\nIf this situation persists past July, then we are looking at a world on its knees, economically. And a world on its knees, eventually, can fall on its face. And that is not an option for any country in this globally connected economy\n\nThe German Economic Institute or The IFO, just reported that the employment barometer of the country has dropped from 93.4 points in March to 86.3 points in April. Too many of the readers it may not sound that big of a deal, a seven-point, give and take, drop.\n\nBut these seven points represent a chaotic number for all four sectors of the German economy; manufacturing, services, trade, and construction. Its export expectations dropped from a positive number to -50.2 in just eight weeks. Never before in its history, since IFO came into existence, has it seen such drastic drops in its calculations.\n\nOther European nations are not too far behind when it comes to facing existential threats. Air France-KLM and Renault SA are looking for immediate bailouts or will have to declare bankruptcies. The United Kingdom had just walked out of the European Union and Covid-19 happened.\n\nUK economic output has contracted by a whopping 35 percent and the Scottish numbers stand at 32 percent according to the OECD. The UK government expects a deficit of 14 percent this year already, and we are only three months into 2020. The worst year in recent memory was during the 2008 crisis when it fell to 11 percent.\n\nRead more: Challenges of Imposing Lockdown: DC Islamabad explains\n\nSo imagine, what we are looking at if the cure is not found soon, and we continue to look into an abyss of uncertainty. Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece were already economically troubled for over a decade. This will bring them to their knees, metaphorically speaking.\n\nThe total size of the EU GDP is 19 trillion dollars. That number represents 22 percent of the estimated $90 trillion world GDP. Imagine a contraction of 10 percent-plus in the EU GDP and a 23 percent contraction in the world GDP. Now stop imagining because it has already brought us there. And, if any country thinks that it will not be affected by this horrid virus, then it needs to change its Minister of Finance or seek help from a mental health professional.\n\nSpeaking of seeking help from a mental health professional, our neighbors' PM Modi needs it the most. All his claims of India not being affected have gone astray. Indian GDP is looking at a 1 percent growth this year, down from the 5 percent claim by the PM at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nWe were just beginning to recover, and COVID happened. To me, the situation feels like a patient being released from a hospital after long treatment and he gets into an accident on his way home. I could not put it in simpler terms.\n\nWe are one of those countries where the economy is based on very resilient people. Economies are made up of people, and people, if resilient, do not fear easily. And this trait, albeit extremely rare to find, is present in the Pakistani nation. We have been through such disasters that Covid-19 has not scared us. Although it should. That being said, the lockdown is not being implemented strictly either, thus resulting in a lesser economic impact at a micro-level.\n\nRead more: US-China Tensions: When Elephants fight grass gets trampled\n\nUnder no circumstances am I saying that our economy is more resilient than the other countries. What I am saying is that two factors have benefitted us. One, we were not at our peak as an economy. Two, we did not have a lot of exports, and our economy was not in an expansion mode before this dreaded virus. So both these facts saved us a little. Just a little.\n\nA major drop in our oil import bill, due to drastically low prices, has helped to bring inflation somewhat under control. Lowering of interest rates has injected an optimistic breath into our capital markets, lowered our corporate loan repayment amounts, and enabled the exit of so-called \"Hot Money\" without any substantial damage to our foreign reserves. We were expecting a lot worst. And when an economy expecting a disaster, only faces a surprising kick, that kick seems like a blessing in disguise compared to the expectations.\n\nFor now, we are alright but if not handled properly, our economy can face some dire consequences. Unemployment will be the biggest challenge, and foreign remittances coming from the GCC will be at risk because of their economies slowing down.\n\nBusinesses and economies can be dealt with, only if the people dealing with them, are still alive to deal with them\n\nTheir unemployment is our headache as well because millions of our Pakistani brethren live and work there. Besides, millions of others spread across the world, who send funds to their families and friends in Pakistan, in addition to making investments here.\n\nSo let us keep our fingers crossed and heads bowed down in prayers. We will God be-willing pull through.\n\nNot much to be said here except the fact that if your country has elections this year, as America does, you are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. In all other countries, I feel that the voters, whenever their elections take place, will vote based on the performance of their governments' handling of this virus.\n\nThe only country which will come out a winner would be China. Its people are the most content from their governments' handling of Covid-19. With a nation full of happy people, its economy will see a V-Shaped recovery. At least domestically. Happy people make happy spenders. Especially after being locked down and facing possible death.\n\nRead more: Why world economy is at the brink of collapse? Investment Banker explains\n\nSo all in all, 2020 is not a year for business. It is a year of survival. Businesses and economies can be dealt with, only if the people dealing with them, are still alive to deal with them.\n\nLet us keep praying that we find a cure soon, and soon means within the next 60 days, or so, because if this situation persists past July, then we are looking at a world on its knees, economically. And a world on its knees, eventually, can fall on its face.

(\"FTA\") announces the declaration of the monthly distributions for certain exchange-traded funds advised by FTA.\n\nThe following dates apply to today's distribution declarations:\n\nFTA is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Funds' investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (\"FTP\"), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $127 billion as of April 30, 2020 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois.\n\nYou should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund before investing. Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\n\nPrincipal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may be short term or may last for an extended period of time, and in either case could result in a substantial economic downturn or recession.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nFirst Trust Municipal CEF Income Opportunity ETF (MCEF) and First Trust CEF Income Opportunity ETF (FCEF) invest in closed-end funds (\"CEFs\"). Because the shares of CEFs cannot be redeemed upon demand, shares of many CEFs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value, which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). There can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any CEF purchased by MCEF or FCEF will ever decrease or when MCEF or FCEF seeks to sell shares of a CEF it can receive the NAV for those shares. MCEF and FCEF may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to the indirect use of leverage through their investment in CEFs. CEFs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns.\n\nAn underlying CEF that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in an underlying CEF concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nAn underlying CEF may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in an underlying CEF containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. An underlying CEF may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nCertain underlying CEFs are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and zero coupon bond risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income. Zero coupon bond risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall because they do not pay interest on a current basis.\n\nThe funds may invest in CEFs and/or ETFs that hold high-yield securities. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nCertain of the fixed-income securities held by certain underlying funds may not have the benefit of covenants which could reduce the ability of the issuer to meet its payment obligations and might result in increased credit risk.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by an underlying CEF could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that an MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when an underlying CEF's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance an underlying CEF's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by an underlying CEF.\n\nA Fund's investment in CEFs and ETFs involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nIncome from the Funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax.\n\nCertain underlying CEFs may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by an underlying CEF or at prices approximately the value at which an underlying CEF is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nThe Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Funds may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nIn 2012, regulators in the United States and the United Kingdom alleged that certain banks, including some banks serving on the panel for U.S. dollar LIBOR, engaged in manipulative acts in connection with their submissions to the British Bankers Association. Manipulation of the LIBOR rate-setting process would raise the risk to the Fund of being adversely impacted if the Fund received a payment based upon LIBOR and such manipulation of LIBOR resulted in lower resets than would have occurred had there been no manipulation. In 2017, the head of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced a desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. There remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of a transition away from LIBOR on the Fund or the financial instruments in which the Fund invests cannot yet be determined.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen a significant increase in loans with weaker lender protections including, but not limited to, limited financial maintenance covenants or, in some cases, no financial maintenance covenants (i.e., \"covenant-lite loans\") that would typically be included in a traditional loan agreement and general weakening of other restrictive covenants applicable to the borrower such as limitations on incurrence of additional debt, restrictions on payments of junior debt or restrictions on dividends and distributions. Weaker lender protections such as the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement and the inclusion of \"borrower-favorable\" terms may impact recovery values and/or trading levels of senior loans in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder an underlying fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce an underlying fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, an underlying fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nThe information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person.

An investment in an underlying CEF concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nAn underlying CEF may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in an underlying CEF containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. An underlying CEF may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nCertain underlying CEFs are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and zero coupon bond risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income. Zero coupon bond risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall because they do not pay interest on a current basis.\n\nThe funds may invest in CEFs and/or ETFs that hold high-yield securities. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nCertain of the fixed-income securities held by certain underlying funds may not have the benefit of covenants which could reduce the ability of the issuer to meet its payment obligations and might result in increased credit risk.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by an underlying CEF could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that an MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when an underlying CEF's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance an underlying CEF's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by an underlying CEF.\n\nA Fund's investment in CEFs and ETFs involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nIncome from the Funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax.\n\nCertain underlying CEFs may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by an underlying CEF or at prices approximately the value at which an underlying CEF is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nThe Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Funds may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nIn 2012, regulators in the United States and the United Kingdom alleged that certain banks, including some banks serving on the panel for U.S. dollar LIBOR, engaged in manipulative acts in connection with their submissions to the British Bankers Association. Manipulation of the LIBOR rate-setting process would raise the risk to the Fund of being adversely impacted if the Fund received a payment based upon LIBOR and such manipulation of LIBOR resulted in lower resets than would have occurred had there been no manipulation. In 2017, the head of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced a desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. There remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of a transition away from LIBOR on the Fund or the financial instruments in which the Fund invests cannot yet be determined.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen a significant increase in loans with weaker lender protections including, but not limited to, limited financial maintenance covenants or, in some cases, no financial maintenance covenants (i.e., \"covenant-lite loans\") that would typically be included in a traditional loan agreement and general weakening of other restrictive covenants applicable to the borrower such as limitations on incurrence of additional debt, restrictions on payments of junior debt or restrictions on dividends and distributions. Weaker lender protections such as the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement and the inclusion of \"borrower-favorable\" terms may impact recovery values and/or trading levels of senior loans in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder an underlying fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce an underlying fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, an underlying fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nThe information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person.

FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (\"FTP\"), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $127 billion as of April 30, 2020 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois.\n\nYou should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund before investing. Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\n\nPrincipal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may be short term or may last for an extended period of time, and in either case could result in a substantial economic downturn or recession.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nFirst Trust Municipal CEF Income Opportunity ETF (MCEF) and First Trust CEF Income Opportunity ETF (FCEF) invest in closed-end funds (\"CEFs\"). Because the shares of CEFs cannot be redeemed upon demand, shares of many CEFs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value, which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). There can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any CEF purchased by MCEF or FCEF will ever decrease or when MCEF or FCEF seeks to sell shares of a CEF it can receive the NAV for those shares. MCEF and FCEF may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to the indirect use of leverage through their investment in CEFs. CEFs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns.\n\nAn underlying CEF that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in an underlying CEF concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nAn underlying CEF may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies.

In addition, there is the risk that an MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives.

FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois.\n\nYou should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund before investing. Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\n\nPrincipal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may be short term or may last for an extended period of time, and in either case could result in a substantial economic downturn or recession.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nFirst Trust Municipal CEF Income Opportunity ETF (MCEF) and First Trust CEF Income Opportunity ETF (FCEF) invest in closed-end funds (\"CEFs\"). Because the shares of CEFs cannot be redeemed upon demand, shares of many CEFs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value, which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). There can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any CEF purchased by MCEF or FCEF will ever decrease or when MCEF or FCEF seeks to sell shares of a CEF it can receive the NAV for those shares. MCEF and FCEF may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to the indirect use of leverage through their investment in CEFs. CEFs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns.\n\nAn underlying CEF that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in an underlying CEF concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nAn underlying CEF may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in an underlying CEF containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. An underlying CEF may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nCertain underlying CEFs are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and zero coupon bond risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income. Zero coupon bond risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall because they do not pay interest on a current basis.\n\nThe funds may invest in CEFs and/or ETFs that hold high-yield securities. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nCertain of the fixed-income securities held by certain underlying funds may not have the benefit of covenants which could reduce the ability of the issuer to meet its payment obligations and might result in increased credit risk.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by an underlying CEF could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (\"MLPs\") are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that an MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when an underlying CEF's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance an underlying CEF's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by an underlying CEF.\n\nA Fund's investment in CEFs and ETFs involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nIncome from the Funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax.\n\nCertain underlying CEFs may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by an underlying CEF or at prices approximately the value at which an underlying CEF is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nThe Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Funds may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nIn 2012, regulators in the United States and the United Kingdom alleged that certain banks, including some banks serving on the panel for U.S. dollar LIBOR, engaged in manipulative acts in connection with their submissions to the British Bankers Association. Manipulation of the LIBOR rate-setting process would raise the risk to the Fund of being adversely impacted if the Fund received a payment based upon LIBOR and such manipulation of LIBOR resulted in lower resets than would have occurred had there been no manipulation. In 2017, the head of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced a desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. There remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of a transition away from LIBOR on the Fund or the financial instruments in which the Fund invests cannot yet be determined.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen a significant increase in loans with weaker lender protections including, but not limited to, limited financial maintenance covenants or, in some cases, no financial maintenance covenants (i.e., \"covenant-lite loans\") that would typically be included in a traditional loan agreement and general weakening of other restrictive covenants applicable to the borrower such as limitations on incurrence of additional debt, restrictions on payments of junior debt or restrictions on dividends and distributions. Weaker lender protections such as the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement and the inclusion of \"borrower-favorable\" terms may impact recovery values and/or trading levels of senior loans in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder an underlying fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce an underlying fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, an underlying fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nThe information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person.

After their remarks, we will open the call to your questions. As the webcast is not enabled for Q&A, please dial in to the call if you would like to ask a question.\n\nThank you, Robert, and welcome to everyone joining today's call. First, I would like to extend our heartfelt sympathies to all those affected by this horrible pandemic and offer our thanks and admiration for the courage of the healthcare providers, first responders and other essential service providers on the front lines.We are all grateful for their dedication and hard work. I am also proud of the way Assured Guaranty's people have stepped up to keep our operations running without interruption, almost entirely from their homes, by implementing the remote technology and business continuity plans we put in place and have tested regularly for many years. We have continued to write new business in both the new issue and secondary markets, and we will continue to provide value for shareholders, issuers and policyholders at a time when bond insurance has never been more important in its support of the efficient function of markets.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Assured Guaranty's overall insurance production was very good even though market turbulence limited March production. PVP of $51 million was 21% higher than in the first quarter of 2019, propelled by a 39% increase in public finance PVP worldwide. The U.S. municipal market environment during the first quarter was bifurcated by the market reaction to the pandemic. Until the end of February, the economy was strong, interest rates were at or near historic lows, and credit spreads were extremely tight. For example, yields on 30-year municipal bonds fell to a record low of 1.38% on March 9th. There was robust demand and strong liquidity in the municipal bond market because long-term municipal mutual funds took in $114 billion of net inflows during the 14 months leading up to March 2020.\n\nThen, from February 24 through March 23, major equity indices collapsed by more than 30%, and during the first four weeks of March, investors pulled out an estimated $41.8 billion, net, out of municipal mutual funds, which caused forced selling by the funds to cover liquidations. The 30-year benchmark yield jumped almost 200 basis points at one point. New issuance in the U.S. public finance market temporarily ground to a halt. For us, this meant $800 million of par of new issues that we were mandated to insure during the quarter were postponed past quarter-end. Our secondary-market business, however, has continued uninterrupted.\n\nEven with the first quarter's generally low yields and tight spreads, and the lack of issuance during part of March, we succeeded in increasing by 22% the par amount of municipal new issues sold with our insurance, compared with last year's first quarter production. All told, across the primary and secondary markets, we insured $2.7 billion of municipal bonds during the period. One result of the market disruption is that investors have turned more attention to credit risk. This has created opportunities for Assured Guaranty that will be reflected in future quarter results in both primary and secondary markets, and we believe these circumstances have driven home to both investors and issuers the value of our guaranty.\n\nOutside of U.S. public finance, most of our new business in the quarter came from international infrastructure finance, most notably through our second solar energy transaction in Spain, which was also the first transaction to be guaranteed by our new French subsidiary. We have continued our strategy of further diversifying our international production.Target markets include Spain, Ireland,France, Germany, as well as Australia. Although some transactions have been delayed in the current COVID-19 environment, credit spreads have widened, and we continue to see relatively strong investor appetite for our product. We continue working on maintaining and expanding investor relationships, and we are also seeing a growing and diversified stream of incoming inquiries in response to the greater visibility we have achieved in the market in recent years.\n\nIn the U.K., the Chancellor's new budget proposes a GBP600 billion investment over the next five years into infrastructure including rail, road, affordable housing and broadband. We have no details on where private investment will fit into this program. We are encouraged that the current government supports significant infrastructure investment.\n\nWhile there are many good reasons in the current environment for investors and issuers in all of our markets to utilize our financial guaranty, keep in mind that this new business will have little impact on 2020 earnings. This is because, while we collect the majority of our premiums upfront, we earn them over the life of each transaction. For example, only approximately 3% of premiums earned in 2019 related to new financial guaranty policies we wrote in 2019.\n\nOur insured portfolio is in good shape to weather this economic disruption. Three-quarters of our insured exposure is to U.S. municipal bonds, a sector that has a very strong track record in stressed economic environments. During the Great Recession and ensuing years, from 2008 to 2013, Assured Guaranty paid claims on only six new U.S. municipal defaults, and we obtained settlements mitigating the ultimate losses in that group. Similarly, our international infrastructure business performed very well, with only a few losses. In the structured finance market, leading into the Great Recession, we declined to insure what turned out to be some of the more high-loss-severity asset classes and transaction structures of that financial crisis. And from 2009 to first quarter 2020, our insured structured finance portfolio decreased 95%, going from $174.6 billion to $9.5 billion. Importantly, from 2008 to 2013, we were profitable each year, earning a total of more than $2.7 billion in adjusted operating income, and we have been profitable each year since.\n\nLooking at U.S. public finance from 2009, the year we acquired AGM, through 2019, the average net losses we paid on bonds of issuers in the 50 states was less than $45 million per year. This excludes our Puerto Rico claims in the latter years of that period. As a U.S.territory, Puerto Rico presents a unique situation, and we are still in the process of negotiations and the exercise of our strong legal rights, which we believe will result in significant recoveries, based on our and the municipal market's successful history of mitigating losses.\n\nU.S. municipalities reacted to their experience of the 2008 financial crisis by generally improving their operating and liquidity positions, which we believe has even better prepared them to ride out this pause in economic activity. COVID-19 appeared after the longest recorded economic expansion, during which municipal governments' tax receipts grew significantly, allowing them to improve their balance sheets and rainy-day funds. Of course, some municipalities are less prepared than others, and in these situations where revenues are materially reduced, downgrades could occur. But downgrades themselves do not cause us to have losses.\n\nOur surveillance department has closely examined and applied stress tests to individual insured transactions in the portfolio sectors that we believe have the highest likelihood of being affected by the pandemic. Among the sectors we consider most at risk, the largest are certain transportation sectors, bonds backed by hotel occupancy taxes, stadiums and certain student housing.\n\nAs a class, municipal bonds are well structured to protect bondholders, with most of our transactions containing covenants that require issuers to increase rates, fees or charges to ensure there are adequate funds to meet debt service requirements, while many also require the maintenance of a debt service reserve fund with up to a year's worth of debt service capacity.\n\nWhile we are still in the early stages of determining the long term economic impact of the pandemic on issuers we insure, at this point, based on our review, we currently do not anticipate material unrecoverable losses as a result of the pandemic.\n\nWe stand ready to meet our obligations to policyholders based on our excess capital, financial liquidity, granular insured portfolio, and structural protections built into our guaranteed transactions. Issuers are likely to reimburse us for liquidity claims, if any, in short order to limit damage to their reputations, credit ratings and capital market access.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and Congress have taken unprecedented steps to limit the economic damage from this crisis, including specific programs for states, municipalities, the municipal bond market, and additional actions are expected. A major infrastructure bill would almost certainly lead to municipal and state bonds being issued to share costs with the federal government, and we would expect to find opportunities among those issues. In the current circumstances, it is sensible economic policy for the federal government to help states and municipalities keep police, firefighters, medical professionals, schoolteachers and other public employees on the payroll until it is safe to restore tax-generating economic activity.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the lockdown has postponed activity in the Title III court, revealing again how the PROMESA process has delayed putting the island on a path to economic health, as this could have all been resolved through consensual negotiations long ago. One of the lessons learned in this crisis does suggest a potential economic stimulus for Puerto Rico, because the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in the U.S. and global medical supply chain, a significant public health and national security challenge that Puerto Rico can help address. It is an opportunity for Puerto Rico to help the nation while it stimulates its own economy by bringing medical manufacturing on to American soil.\n\nThe island has had a long history of producing pharmaceuticals, supported years ago by Federal tax incentives whose removal set the stage for Puerto Rico's economic decline. Almost 50 pharmaceutical facilities still operate there, and a large, experienced workforce is available to the industry. This is an important untapped strength of Puerto Rico that U.S. policy makers should recognize. If the federal government can recraft appropriate incentives to reinvigorate the industry, Puerto Rico can both help address the immediate medical crisis and also provide long-term domestic capacity that could reduce U.S. reliance on foreign manufacturers. Also, oil prices have come down dramatically, and PREPA has been tasked by the Oversight Board to report by May 22nd on how it can take advantage of this development. PREPA has already announced that the reduced fuel costs will result in significant decreases in electricity rates.\n\nOur asset management segment, which is still a relatively small part of our business, was affected by the market dislocation caused by the pandemic. This will likely affect our plans for new CLO issuance in 2020, the pace at which the legacy wind-down funds will be liquidated, and near-term capital raising. However, we believe our experience in structured finance will allow us to take advantage of market opportunities in the medium to long term, and we believe in the long-term value and returns of this business for Assured Guaranty.\n\nAs a large originator of CLO assets and currently a top 20 CLO manager both in the US and globally, we are well positioned in the current environment to find attractive opportunities in both the CLO and asset-backed markets. We are currently focused on the more liquid asset classes that have shown excellent credit resiliency in severe downturns.\n\nAt the corporate level, we look to prudently continue our capital management program. Unlike the experience of some other companies, we have no need for government assistance. And given our excess capital position and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe the most appropriate decision is to continue to buyback shares at their current extreme discount to adjusted book value. As always, we will continue to assess and potentially adjust the level of our share repurchase program. I am confident that Assured will weather this current economic challenge and prove again the resiliency of our business model, which is designed to withstand global economic disruptions. In fact, we came into 2020 with what I consider the strongest financial position in our history, with better insured leverage, less than half of what it was in 2009, and an insured portfolio with a more conservative distribution of sector risk than 10 years ago, including a far smaller and well-performing structured finance sector, below investment-grade exposure at a 10-year level of less than 4% of net par outstanding and far more capital and liquidity than necessary to maintain our financial strength ratings.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2019, our insurance subsidiaries paid $11 billion of gross public finance and structured finance claims but recovered nearly half of those payments through reinsurance and loss mitigation efforts. Meanwhile, throughout that time, our consolidated claims-paying resources remained at $11 billion or higher.\n\nLooking at the last five years, Assured Guaranty has earned an average of over $600 million of adjusted operating income each year, including $400 million of average annual net investment income. Our high-quality investment portfolio and cash total $9.8 billion and provide far more than enough liquidity because we are only obligated to cover shortfalls in interest and principal payments when they are due. We can anticipate and plan for our liquidity needs, and many of our insured transactions have designated funds available for debt service for the rest of the year.\n\nEverything I've said about the strength of our company was seconded in a report S&P released about the bond insurance industry on April 3rd, when the pandemic had already disrupted markets. Acknowledging the significant pandemic-caused market volatility and the fiscal challenges ahead for all U.S. public finance sectors, S&P wrote, quote, We view the potential impact to U.S. bond insurers as somewhat low at this time. Notwithstanding the current macroeconomic environment, defaults of issues insured by bond insurers are not expected to be widespread. They went on to note the potential for ratings migration of some insured issues, but said this was not expected to put stress on the insurers' capital adequacy given the insurers' robust capital positions. I encourage you to read their report.\n\nLet me conclude by reviewing four important points to take away from today's call. First, we are pleased with our first quarter production, which increased year-over-year despite the market disruption. Second, the resulting environment may well create opportunities, with higher municipal interest rates, widening credit spreads and concerns over credit driving more demand for our product. Third, we have looked carefully at our individual insured transactions in the sectors we think most likely to be affected by the pandemic's economic impact and do not currently expect permanent unrecoverable losses, or liquidity claims this year that we cannot easily manage. And finally, we remain committed to our capital management program, subject to the availability of funds at the holding company.\n\nFor more than three decades, we have focused on building a company that will protect its policyholders and provide value to shareholders even in times like these. That is exactly what we've done, and I believe the current environment will shine a spotlight on the benefits of our unconditional and irrevocable guaranty and the strength of our unique business model.\n\nThank you, Dominic, and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to pick up where Dominic left off and reemphasize the strength of our balance sheet, capital position, and business model, all of which enable us to withstand the turbulence in global markets caused by this pandemic. Even in this environment, we managed to achieve record per-share highs for both adjusted operating shareholders' equity of $67.25 per share or $6.1 billion and adjusted book value per share of $98.02 per share or $8.8 billion. Our financial strength and stability are supported by the quality of our invested assets and insured portfolio. The investment portfolio and cash, are valued at $9.8 billion, has an average rating of AA minus and generates a stable stream of investment income. In our insured portfolio, over 96% of par outstanding is investment-grade, and with deferred premium revenue of $3.8 billion, it will generate a long-term stream of future earnings.\n\nTurning now to the quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating income was $33 million in the first quarter of 2020, which consists primarily of an $85 million gain from our insurance segment, a $9 million loss from our new asset management segment, and a $39 million loss from our corporate division, which is where we track our holding company results.\n\nStarting with the insurance segment, the adjusted operating income was $85 million, compared to $111 million in the first quarter of 2019. Part of the change in the insurance segment adjusted operating income is attributable to an $8 million after-tax mark-to-market loss on our investments in Assured Investment Management funds. These investments are marked-to-market each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded as a component of adjusted operating income in the line item: equity in earnings of investees. The market dislocation and volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was the primary driver of the mark-to-market losses in the CLO and asset-backed Assured Investment Management funds in which we invested. As of March 31, 2020, the insurance companies had collectively invested $192 million into Assured Investment Management funds, and will invest another $300 million over time. We expect that adjusted operating income will be subject to more volatility than in the past, when our investments were almost entirely in fixed-income securities, and our long-term view of the enhanced return we will receive from the Assured Investment Management funds remains positive.\n\nNet earned premiums and credit derivative revenues in the first quarter of 2020 were $107 million, compared with $126 million in the first quarter of 2019.The variance is mainly due to lower accelerations from refundings, which were $15 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $26 million in the first quarter of 2019, as well as the scheduled amortization of the insured portfolio.\n\nNet investment income for the insurance segment was $83 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared with $99 million in the first quarter of 2019. The change was primarily due to a decline in average invested balances in the externally managed portfolio as funds were deployed during the year expand into alternative investments, including Assured investment management funds, which recorded a fair value in a separate line item as opposed to net investment income and to repurchase shares. The average balance of loss mitigation securities also declined as a large troubled insured transaction in the portfolio was favorably settled, and proceeds were reinvested in lower yielding assets.\n\nLoss expense in the insurance segment was down to $18 million in the first quarter of 2020, from $44 million in the first quarter of 2019. In both periods, the expense was primarily related to economic loss development on certain Puerto Rico exposures, offset in part by a benefit in the RMBS portfolio. The economic benefit in the first quarter 2020 was $3 million, which consisted of a benefit of $63 million on RMBS exposures, partially offset by loss development of $59 million in the U.S. public finance sector-primarily attributable to Puerto Rico exposures.\n\nThe net benefit attributable to U.S. RMBS was mainly related to higher excess spread on transactions whose insured debt is linked to LIBOR, which decreased this quarter, but whose assets are partially fixed rate. The effect of changes in discount rates, which is included in economic development during the quarter, was a loss of $31 million, of which $25 million related to first lien RMBS. In the asset management segment, adjusted operating income was a loss of $9 million. We had previously announced our strategy to transition the investment focus and business model of our Assured Investment Management platform toward its core strategies, including an orderly wind-down of certain hedge funds and legacy opportunity funds.\n\nWe had expected the restructuring to continue throughout 2020, but, depending on the duration and market impact of the pandemic, the execution of our strategy may take longer than originally anticipated. Prior to the COVID-19 market disruptions, we had made good progress on the wind-down of legacy funds, with outflows of $875 million in the first quarter. During that time, the funds sold $258 million of notional CLO equity, which contributed to the increase in fee earning AUM from $8 billion as of December 31, 2019 to $9.5 billion as of March 31, 2020.\n\nWe believe the effect of the pandemic on market conditions and increased volatility may present attractive opportunities for the alternative asset management industry that Assured Investment Management may be able to capitalize on, and so our long-term outlook for the asset management platform remains positive. In our corporate division, the holding companies currently have cash and investments available for liquidity needs and capital management activities of approximately $220 million, of which $28 million resides in AGL.\n\nAdjusted operating loss for the corporate division was a loss of $39 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with a $25 million loss in the first quarter of 2019. This mainly consists of interest expense on the U.S. holding companies' public long-term debt and intercompany debt to the insurance companies. Intercompany debt proceeds were primarily used to fund the Blue Mountain Acquisition. It also includes board of director and other corporate expenses. The results for the first quarter of 2020 include a $5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the purchase of $23 million in AGMH principal, purchased at favorable pricing for a yield of 7.5%. The loss represents the difference between the purchase price and carrying value of the debt, which includes the unamortized fair value adjustments that were recorded upon the acquisition of AGMH in 2009. The first quarter 2020 also included a $5 million writedown of an equity investment.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, the effective tax rate may fluctuate from period to period based on the proportion of income in different tax jurisdictions. In the first quarter of 2020, the effective tax rate was 24.7%, compared with 13.1% in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, we recorded a $55 million net loss this quarter. This included large, but offsetting, mark-to-market adjustments on both our credit derivatives and committed capital securities, which we expect will reverse over time with no economic impact. We also had a $62 million loss due to changes in foreign exchange rates of the British pound and the Euro. The FX loss primarily relates to premiums receivable, which represent the present value of future premium installments that have maturity dates far into the future.\n\nTurning to our capital management strategy, in the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 3.6 million shares for $116 million, for an average price of $32.03 per share. Since the end of the quarter, we have purchased an additional 3.3 million shares for $92.8 million. Since January 2013, our successful capital management program has returned $3.4 billion to shareholders, resulting in a 58% reduction in total shares outstanding. As always, future share repurchases are contingent on available free cash, our capital position and market conditions.\n\nThe effect of the cumulative share repurchase program on first quarter 2020 adjusted operating income was approximately $0.09 per share, bringing adjusted operating income for the quarter to $0.36 per share. The cumulative effect of these repurchases was a benefit of approximately $20.03 per share in adjusted operating shareholders' equity, and approximately $36.86 in adjusted book value per share, which helped drive these important metrics to record highs.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to our operator, to give you the instructions for the Q&A period. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Tommy McJoynt with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas McJoynt -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I hope everyone is doing well? When you think about the potential for municipalities to get downgraded, on a net basis, do you kind of view that positively because of the future opportunity that it creates for AGO's guarantee in the sense that it's more valuable? Or does the strain on the current insured portfolio outweigh that?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, that's a good question. So you hate to say it buy typically, market disruptions are normally a -- create a very highly incentivized marketplace for us because, as you say, anytime you've got issues relative to credit performance, which is reflective of credit downgrades, the desire or the attractiveness of our insurance obviously increases both in value and visibility, and therefore, we expect to see more demand. And if you read any of the recent articles, so I'm not giving my opinion, but if you read some of the recent articles, there's been a consistent revised improved forecast for insurance penetration. So we've been averaging around, say, 6%. I see articles that now refer to a potential penetration throughout the remainder of the year, obviously, once markets recover, like at the 10% level. Obviously, in the same token, as spreads widen, the rates increase, we get paid based on debt service.\n\nSo not only do you see more demand for your product, you get to charge more premium. So typically, in this environment, it really is a benefit, even though it's off of a negative situation. The other thing I would say is, remember, downgrades within the investment-grade classes are not significant capital users. It's only after an issuer gets downgraded below investment grade that there's a significant bump in capital and even that's in percentage terms. So based our excess capital position and as S&P noted in their report, they even believe that there will be some downgrades that shouldn't have any impact whatsoever on the performance of our portfolio or our ratings. So you're right, in a way, disruption causes opportunity, disruption will cause increased demand, better our pricing. So -- and then also an increase in rates increases the return on our portfolio. So we get benefited on both sides of the balance sheet. And much like in 2008, 2009, as you can see, based on the numbers I quoted in my speech, our performance was spectacular during those periods as well, much as in the asset management area as well. That when you have capital and there's opportunity, you can obviously take advantage of the dislocation in prices.\n\nThomas McJoynt -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And does your outlook anticipate some sort of funding help from the federal government like I think you mentioned a major infrastructure bill? Or is that kind of --would that be kind of icing on the cake?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, we don't count on that relative to what we look at, but it's unique in that. If you think about it, in '08, '09, the government's response was typically to the financial institutions and large corporations. And at that time, we had tremendous amount of consumer exposure through our RMBS and other exposures. You look at us today, A, the portfolio is a lot smaller. Our insured leverage is way down. Our structured finance, I mean, at $140 plus billion back in 2009 to be under $10 billion today, really gives you the impression or gives you the specific evidence of how little we have exposed. But yet the government response in 2020 to their credit has been across all borders, right? They've gone to the consumer, they've gone to the municipalities, they've gone to the financial markets. So the amount of government aid, which is significant, seems to be better spread, which to me, will also kind of limit the depth of the downside. Like I said, go back to '08, '09 and look where the government provided support and where it is today. I think that response is, obviously, for us, better appropriated across all exposures in the portfolio.\n\nThomas McJoynt -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nRegarding Blue Mountain,obviously, there was plenty of volatility around March and April. Did that cause enough kind of shake out in that business where you feel like the opportunity for Blue Mountain has improved? Or was it not stressful enough, I guess, you could say?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, so two things. One, if you look at the quarter and understand the quarter shows some impacts of the market and the pandemic. But most of the quarter changes or shortfalls are really timing or temporary. So obviously, in the asset management, we have great expectations for what that's going to deliver for Assured Guaranty. However, in the current environment, they weren't able to get as much of the legacy assets sold. They weren't able to issue as much CLO opportunity. They weren't able to raise as much funds. As we talked about last year at the end of the year, we had to carry expenses that although we identified to be expenses related to the run-off business, and therefore, will fall off, we are paying some severance and some retention. We couldn't accrue at that at the year-end, so that's going to bleed in through 2020, which we would have hoped we would have been able to put in 2019. All of those things, though, are not permanent declines. And the same thing with the mark-to-market, with accounting, and I'm a former accountant, even though I won't admit that in public, right? They're now pushing for current value on everything.\n\nWell, current value has that one problem where you have these market disruptions, you got a price to the current value, although you don't believe that is the long-term economic value nor does it reflect the long-term economic returns that you expect, but you're stuck with the market loss. So at the end of the day, as I look at our results, to me, the delay in say, recognizing refunding-that catches up. We're not a consumption business. In other words, the sale that we miss in March does come back to us. We don't lose it, right? People that, in effect, plan and budget and approve financings, need to get those financings accomplished for the reasons that were originally put into their budgets and plans.\n\nSo we're very different in that regard. As I talked about on my speech, most of our 2020 earnings are already known. So in terms of protection of 2020, we're in pretty good shape. Number two, our demand should increase. And number three, we don't lose clients, and most of the impairment that we faced in the first quarter are really based on mark-to-market temporary or just delayed activity that is fully expected, but doesn't really affect the long-term economic value or returns of the company.\n\nThomas McJoynt -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nRight. And just in terms of the number of CLO managers that kind of serves as the competition, obviously, many of them are subscale. Did you get the sense that March and April created enough volatility that there should be more consolidation than you expected pre-COVID?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'll let Andrew answer that since he's our expert on that environment.\n\nAndrew Feldstein -- Chief Investment Officer and Head of Asset Management\n\nI think that's a good insight. Look, there's 125 CLO managers in the world, 30 of them with more than $5 billion in AUM and those 30 control, maybe 60%, 65% of the market. And it is the case that the smaller independent managers are going to find this environment more challenging. And I do think that gives us an opportunity, an acquisition opportunity, whether it's whole businesses or CLO contracts. Because we're in a stronger position, just the beginning scale of our CLO business with $13 billion under management. And then, of course, the greater stability and access to capital that we get because we're part of the Assured family. So I think you're right. I think your insight is right. And I think over the next nine months, either organically or through acquisitions, the struggles of smaller independent managers are going to create opportunities for the larger ones.\n\nOur next question comes from Josh Esterov with CreditSights. Please go ahead.\n\nJoshua Esterov -- CreditSights -- Analyst\n\nHello, good morning. Appreciate you taking my question. I see on some of the slide information that you published that of the 6,500 direct U.S. public finance obligors in the insured portfolio, you expect roughly 10 to see claims in excess of recoveries. But if you put the recovery portion aside for a moment, could you talk about where you see at least temporary disruption that could lead to some level of claims payments in the foreseeable future. Is that still mostly limited to transportation, student housing and some of those other pockets of exposure you mentioned earlier?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, as we said, we actually -- we review the entire portfolio annually for every risk. And of course, certain risk get more attention than that, that are looked at either quarterly or monthly and some like Puerto Rico probably daily. So we're constantly culling our portfolio to understand the risk. We're constantly reaching out to the issuers to make sure we understand the current financial position. So once the pandemic hit, we immediately went back to the portfolio, basically divided it among high risk, medium risk, low risk, went out to actually speak to the high-risk people, which, as you identified, transportation, hotel occupancy, student housing or some of the more critical ones, healthcare. And as we looked at that portfolio and really tried to ascertain first, what is the total debt service due in the next six to 12 months as well as over the next two years, what is the availability of funds at the issuer, either based on cash on hand or debt service reserve funds and try to map out where we thought there could be some potential request for payment and the numbers are incredibly, incredibly small. These are very well engineered, well protected, typically have the availability of debt service reserve funds. So even as we look to the liquidity payments, so ignoring the recovery, right, it was an incredibly small number and something easily absorbed within the organization's available cash and cash flow.\n\nSo we continue to cull that. We continue to reach out to our issuers to make sure we understand the portfolio. We try to get updates as frequently as possible. Obviously, we just had our Board meeting and went through a full kind of dissertation with the Board on each credit, each risk. So we're in very good shape. And historically, there's not been a lot of defaults in the municipal market. If you go back and look at the published data from like S&P and Moody's, you're talking like basis points of ultimate loss per year in the municipal marketplace. Why? Because they rely on the market's access other like some large kind of headline credits they think they can behave differently but there's always a long-term cost to it.\n\nMost people want to and do pay their bills and will restructure or negotiate or provide additional protection to make sure they can maintain that. Remember, in everybody's budget, there is what I'll call discretionary spending. So as you see revenue shortfalls, even before you start capping reserve funds, etc, you just eliminate capex or some other discretionary funds to make sure that you can make the balance of payments relative to debt service because that's a critical component. People do not want to get downgraded. And in most cases, in our experience, a threat of a downgrade typically results in the insurer paying the debt service because they don't want the downgrade and have that additional cost or lack of market access put on their backs.\n\nJoshua Esterov -- CreditSights -- Analyst\n\nI appreciate that. That's helpful color. I hope everyone stays safe.\n\nAnd our next question comes from Giuliano Bologna with BTIG. Please go ahead.\n\nGiuliano Bologna -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nHi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess starting off on the new business front, is there any way of thinking about pricing trends? Obviously, as credit spreads are wider, you can usually charge more, and also as there's concerns about credit, you can charge more. Is there any sense of the magnitude of the pricing changes that you might be able to capture in the near term?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe don't really give you that number in that detail. I can tell you that pricing has improved across the board. And someone might say, well hang on a second. Let me go back and look at your par written in the first quarter against premium versus last year, it's down. Only because there's a little credit in last year that was significant called Chicago. It was part of their refunding that really skewed the first quarter number rate wise last year. But on average, the rate is up reasonably -- and I don't want to give you a number, but it's up significantly in the end of the first quarter, and we expect that to continue through at least the next few months, if not the remainder of the year.\n\nGiuliano Bologna -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nThat makes a lot of sense. Then thinking about the investments into the investment management funds, you invested $192 million so far and the target is $500 million. Is there any sense of timing around those investments or how fast you would continue investing?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOur Chief Investment Officer will answer that question.\n\nAndrew Feldstein -- Chief Investment Officer and Head of Asset Management\n\nYes. The pace picked up a little bit in March and then continued in April. And it was really because opportunities in the market arose. So I don't think we'll continue at the pace that we saw in April. We do expect credit markets are going to normalize a little faster in this crisis than they did after 2008. Two reasons. First, unlike 2008, the banking system is healthy. We don't have a problem with our financial transmission system. It's a different kind of crisis, worse in many ways. And, but better in that way, better, in that the banking system is sound. Second, the response from the public sector has been much quicker and much larger in this crisis. And that's both from the Fed and from fiscal stimulus programs. So the duration of the opportunity to make the kinds of investments we did in April may slow. So I don't think we'll keep up that pace. But we do expect that by the end of the year or sometime in the beginning of next year, we will have deployed that capital.\n\nGiuliano Bologna -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nThat's great. Thank you for that. And then just one quick follow-up, I guess, switching back a little bit to the insured portfolio for a second. One of the things that's obviously come up as a lot of people are asking about exposures. And specifically, for as an example, the New York MTA came up. And I think what a lot of people missed was the fact that you probably have seven or eight times coverage in the New York MTA from a -- because it's a revenue bond and you have a lot of liens on revenues. Is there any sense within the transportation portfolio, kind of what the coverage is when you start looking at a lot of the revenue coverages in those deals?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, the transportation portfolio is one of the portions of the portfolio that benefits the most from structural protections, and that's in two regards. One, cash on hand, and we do a current sweep of cash on hand so we know what the available funds are and 2, debt service reserves. So as we look at the airports, MTA, et cetera. The debt service reserve is significant that we will pay claim or pay debt service for a minimum of six months, if not 12 months. Obviously, MTA is kind of a special circumstance where the revenue box only accounted for around 50% of its total revenue relative to the ability to beat expenses and pay debt service. We have a gross revenue pledge on MTA, which makes it obviously even higher protected. And I think they've already gone on record saying that bankruptcy is not an issue, and they will continue to fund all payments.\n\nGiuliano Bologna -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nThat makes sense and I appreciate that additional color and perspective there. I will jump back into queue. Thank you.\n\nAnd our next question today comes from Jordan Hymowitz with Philadelphia Financial. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Hymowitz -- Philadelphia Financial -- Analyst\n\nThanks, guys. A couple of questions. You continue to buy back stock even after the quarter. Can you confirm that there is nothing in terms of state authorization or anything that would prevent you from buying back that $500 million this year, if needed?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nRemember, during our buyback is composed of two portions, right? Our ability to buy back or the availability of funds. One is what has created normally out of the operating company, subject to no approval process other than notification and the payment of dividends; and two, to top it up to the level that we'd like to get to on an annual basis, we typically rely on special dividend. Obviously, in today's environment, we fully expect that they're going to be a little hesitant to approve a special dividend. So that portion of the funding will have to be delayed at some point in time.\n\nObviously, in my remarks, we're committed to capital management. We believe the strength of the balance sheet, the granularity of the portfolio, the protections that are implied therein, still provide us good opportunity. And then, of course, add that to the significant discount that's now currently available to us in the stock. And we did some goofy numbers. So people, especially the accountants like to play with numbers, so I'll give them some credit. If you look at where the price is versus what we anticipate the price to be for this year relative to the stock authorization buyback, we're going to probably still buy back more shares than we would have had in the original authorization at the share price not reflective of the volatility of this current pandemic.\n\nSo bottom line is we still do require special dividends at some level at some point in the year to top-up the funding. Now we can accomplish it through other sources, like borrowing if we wanted to do that. So all things are on the table for us. Obviously, as I say, we're committed to the program. We believe we're in great financial condition to allow us to do that. And just a matter of getting the available funds with the holding company to basically execute the strategy where we're at today.\n\nJordan Hymowitz -- Philadelphia Financial -- Analyst\n\nOK. Second is, do you still anticipate the portfolio flattening this year in terms of the decline?\n\nDominic J. Frederico -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThat's a great question. Obviously, we looked at 2020 as the year of the balance, right? And obviously, with the market disruption, obviously, there's been some delay. It really depends on when the recovery begins, when these shelters at home are lifted, when normal becomes more normal if there will ever be a normal. So having all those caveats. But as I said, the nice thing about our situation is we typically don't lose the customer. It just delays the customer. So whether our hopeful bounce in 2020 goes to the first or second quarter of 2021, I really don't think it makes much difference. I think we see the track, we see the trend and we know that the acceleration of the amortization of the portfolio, by and large, has run its course. So therefore -- and we know we've got good activity across all of our profit lines in the current marketplace, we're really impressed by the number of inquiries we're getting across the structured finance and international infrastructure areas, obviously, the domestic municipal market is more or less a flow market. There's fundamental demand all the time there. But we still see an increased interest in insurance anyway because of the current volatility.\n\nSo if things work out well and the recovery is steeper than what people think and markets normalize, I think we'll get the balance in 2020. If not it goes to 2021 because of the pandemic.\n\nRobert A. Bailenson -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nI also want to add, Jordan, if you look at last year, the year-end numbers, our year-end UPR was greater than the prior year. So we did increase our store of earnings at the end of last year.\n\nAnd our next question today comes from Geoffrey Dunn with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoffrey Dunn -- Dowling & Partners -- Analyst\n\nThanks. Good morning. Jordan beat me to the punch on the buyback question. But Rob, could you just give me the breakdown of the primary and secondary new business this quarter for muni?\n\nRobert A. Bailenson -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure. Secondary PVP for the first quarter was $9 million versus $22 last year. Dominic did mention there was a significant transaction last year which was Chicago. That's the delta for the difference, significantly, and the par was $230 million for the first quarter of 2020 versus $338 million in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.\n\nRobert Tucker -- Senior Managing Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, operator.

Citing the coronavirus pandemic, Town Supervisor Paul Feiner slashed fire district payments by 12%, citing an agreement he'd made with fire chiefs in the town's three district.\n\nHowever, the board of the Greenville Fire District, located in the hamlet of Edgemont, says Feiner had no right withhold $1.2 million. Its chief reports to the board.\n\nGreenburgh paid the district just $8.6 million, with a promise to pay the rest by July 15.\n\n\"We are not aware of any lawful basis to do anything but pay 100% of the warrant in a timely fashion,\" said Greenville Commissioner Jonathan Faust. \"We have not engaged or spoken or negotiated on this topic with the town. We are in the dark about it.\"\n\nFeiner's plan to withhold fire district money was part of the town's response to the economic downturn, with the annual bill for town and county taxes due on April 30. Fire district levies are included in that bill. Under state law, Westchester towns collect taxes for school districts, Westchester county, the town, and taxing districts within those municipalities.\n\nFeiner said the town had withheld the fire district funds because the town had collected just 88% of the total of $191 million billed for town, county and fire taxes. It was paying the fire district 88% of its tax levy to reflect the town's shortfall.\n\nBut withholding the funds was a break with the town's normal practice of fully paying the fire district tax warrant, even if it had not collected all of the taxes by April 30.\n\nTown Tax Receiver Ann Povella said the town for the past three years has collected about 90% of what's billed by April 30. She said Tuesday she expected the town to hit the 90% mark this week.\n\nCommission Chairman Walter Groden said that the town had never made a partial payment in the past, even though collections by April 30 were roughly the same as they had been in years past. He noted that the town has the authority to recover delinquent tax payments from scofflaws through tax liens or foreclosures. Fire districts have no such powers because the town serves as the tax collector for them.\n\nEdgemont attorney Robert Bernstein said numerous court decision have ruled that towns do not have discretion over paying the full amount they are asked to collect because they have the power to enforce collections through tax liens and foreclosures.\n\nA spokeswoman for state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli declined comment.\n\nFeiner said he withheld the funds as part of a county program that reduced penalties for late payment of taxes to taxpayers facing financial hardships caused by the coronavirus.\n\n\"The only way this works is for the town to pay fire districts what we collect and then pay the balance after July,\" Feiner wrote in an April 23 email to Greenburgh's three fire chiefs. \"We do not have the funds to pay the fire district dollars we haven't collected.\"\n\nREJECTED: Feiner rejects Edgemont petition\n\nNEW PETITION: Edgemont tries a second time with new petition\n\nSETBACK: High court won't hear Edgemont appeal\n\nThe town last week opted into the county plan to reduce late-payment penalties to 0.5% through May 30 and 1% by July 15 for those suffering hardships. Feiner said that the town made late-payment reductions for taxpayers contingent up Greenburgh making partial payments to the fire districts.\n\nThere was no such requirement in the county law allowing the reduced penalties.\n\nFeiner said he believed the Greenville Fire District backed his plan because he had received a supportive email from fire district Treasurer Lisa Dinon, an employee of the district who does not serve on the district's governing board.\n\n\"If the fire district doesn't want us to offer Edgemont residents the hardship provisions, they should appear at a public meeting and explain why, and then we could send a note to say that it doesn't apply to you,\" he said. \"It's ironic that the wealthiest section of town doesn't want to give residents who have lost their jobs these hardships reductions when everyone else is cooperating.\"\n\nBy Friday, however, Feiner said that the program was available to all Greenburgh residents.\n\nFeiner has long feuded with Greenburgh's three independent fire districts, which have rosters of paid firefighters, and chiefs who earn in excess of $200,000 - more than his salary of about $160,000. He was particularly irked that Greenburgh Fire Commission Chairman Walter Groden has not participated in recent Town Board sessions regarding the coronavirus.\n\nFeiner's ongoing battle with Edgemont intensified in the past three years. The hamlet's petition to become Greenburgh's seventh village back is in state Supreme Court for a second round of costly litigation over whether its petition to hold a vote was valid.\n\nHow this impacts the fire district's ability to borrow money in the future remains to be seen. Greenville counts on annual payments - in full - from the town when it assures purchasers of municipal bonds that it has a dependable income stream.\n\n\"As a practical matter, the town paid 88%, which adequately funds our operation through July,\" Faust said. \"On the other hand we simply don't know how bond underwriters will evaluate the town's actions here.\"", "uri": "6060966622", "url": "https://www.lohud.com/story/money/personal-finance/taxes/david-mckay-wilson/2020/05/08/feiner-clashes-greenville-fire-over-1-2-million-tax-monies/3098983001/"}], "6060891060": [463953153, {"sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "published_on": "2020-05-08T20:15:00Z", "name": "Short-term munis rally as investors contemplate negative UST rates", "dtype": "news", "pk": 463953153, "text": "The short end of the municipal curve rallied hard on Friday as ratios enticed crossover buyers, investors considered the potential for a negative Fed funds rate, and the Fed buying on the one- to three-year pushed yields down by as much as 15 basis points.\n\nTriple-A benchmarks also saw bumps out longer of three to four basis points -- still meaningful for a market that just saw California update its potential revenue losses to top $120 billion.\n\nThe week ahead will see large taxable corporate CUSIP deals from Duke University and Emory along with a large New York City Transitional Finance Authority deal and Texas and California issuers with about $5 billion on tap.\n\nHigh-grade trading Friday showed the disparate credit picture that investors are facing; they now need to dig deeper into municipal financials and the backstops they have on certain bonds to make investment decisions.\n\nGeorgia GO 5s of 2021 traded early Friday at 0.54%-0.52%.

The sharp drop in short rates is bringing down the muni percent of Treasury yields by substantial amounts, but they still remain elevated.\n\nThe Treasury yield curve from three months to two years is essentially flat, with only two basis points between them (0.1% and 0.12%).\n\n\"With two years yields at this level, a new issue would come with a 0% if auctioned today,\" ICE said.\n\nMeanwhile, Illinois was trading cheaper than Buckeye Ohio tobacco bonds this week, with Illinois facing 425- to 450-plus basis point spreads against AAA benchmarks.

Sellers who needed to raise cash--mutual fund managers facing fund redemptions, investors who suddenly needed funds to meet margin calls, heavily indebted hedge funds forced to unwind positions--sold assets willy-nilly, without regard to valuation, zeroing in on the investments that were liquid and easily disposed of.\n\nAnd therein lies an opportunity for income-starved investors, who can now find yields on assets such as high-quality stocks, real estate investment trusts and high-yield bonds that were unavailable in recent years. We'll guide you through levels of risk and potential reward.\n\nSEE ALSO: 11 Best E-Commerce Stocks for Electrifying ReturnsA Change (and a Caution)\n\nNote that, compared with previous years, we have dropped two investment categories: foreign bonds and master limited partnerships. Given currency risks, investors are not compensated with high-enough returns in international bonds (yields on many foreign sovereign bonds are negative). As for MLPs, lower corporate tax rates, thanks to recent changes in the tax code, have made the MLP structure less compelling for investors. And the fortunes of many are tied to the battered energy sector.\n\nBut before you reach for some attractive yields and shoulder more risk in your portfolio amid this bear market, keep a few things in mind. First, this is a pandemic of indeterminate length; because it's impossible to predict how long it will take to play out--or how severe the economic recession will be--it pays to practice some humility. It also pays to have a financial plan in place before piling into high-yielding assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all portfolio, due to variables such as age, health, employment status, liabilities and risk tolerance. But a good rule of thumb is that prior to investing in volatile, high-risk/high-return asset classes such as stocks, you should ensure that you have liquid reserves of cash or cash equivalents to fund a year or two of living expenses, and that you can count on at least five to seven years' worth of cash, high-quality bonds and projected distributions from bonds, money markets and the like to meet intermediate-term liabilities. Such planning will enable you to ride out even a lengthy bear market without being forced to sell when asset prices are down.\n\nShort-Term Accounts\n\nYields on short-term, fixed-income accounts and securities follow the Fed's short-term interest rate. Now that the Fed has lowered that rate to zero to provide a monetary jolt to the system, yields available on CDs, bank savings and money market accounts are rapidly headed lower. But today, the focus for cash and short-term liquid assets is more on return of capital than return on capital.\n\nThe risks: In many ways, the recent turmoil in financial markets recalls the acute distress of the financial crisis of 2008-09. The Fed has been working overtime to provide liquidity and keep markets functioning. But as in the last crisis, there are questions about whether uninsured money market mutual funds can maintain their $1-a-share value. Thus, explicit federal government guarantees, such as on government securities and FDIC-insured accounts and CDs, have become more valuable. Unfortunately, assuming a 2% inflation rate, cash held in your short-term accounts will lose purchasing power over time. But such is the reality of avoiding risk today with your cash reserves.\n\nHow to invest: In an environment of severe economic and financial distress and uncertainty, think about safety, or insurance, rather than reaching for yield with your cash reserves and liquid assets. Federal government guarantees are particularly important. You can find relatively high rates offered online for savings accounts and CDs.\n\nFor instance, FDIC-insured CIT Bank offers 1.75% for online savings accounts, with a minimum account balance of $100. You can earn 1.85% on a one- or two-year CD, with a $500 minimum deposit, purchased online from Marcus by Goldman Sachs (you pick up little or no interest by going out longer in maturity due to the remarkably flat yield curve). BMO Harris Bank also offers 1.85% for either a one-year CD (compared with a national average of 0.46%) or a two-year CD, with a minimum balance of $5,000.\n\nYou can find safety and liquidity with very low volatility in iShares Short Treasury Bond (symbol SHV, $111, yield 0.19%). This exchange-traded fund's Treasury holdings mature in less than one year--the bulk of them in 2020--and come with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. You can also purchase T-bills directly from the federal government through www.treasurydirect.gov--though six- and 12-month T-bills currently yield only a miserly 0.16%.\n\nExpect money market yields to head lower as the funds' current holdings mature and proceeds are reinvested in lower-yielding paper. Vanguard Prime Money Market (VMMXX, 0.81%) charges a fee of only 0.16% but is not federally insured. If you feel safer with government securities, consider Vanguard Federal Money Market (VMFXX, 0.54%), charging 0.11%.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bankruptcy Watch: 10 Retail Stocks at Growing RiskMunicipal Bonds\n\nThe main appeal of muni bonds, which are IOUs issued by state and local governments in the U.S., is that interest income is free from federal taxes--and, for bonds issued in your state of residency, free from state and local taxes as well. During normal times, the $4 trillion muni market is a placid place, quite stable with only small price movements despite a relatively thinly traded market.\n\nBut these are far from normal times. When markets went crazy in the second half of March, investors suddenly yanked billions of dollars out of muni funds--even those invested in highly rated debt. Managers of muni bond funds were forced to sell holdings aggressively to meet shareholder redemptions. Muni ETFs began trading at unprecedented discounts to their net asset values, which reflect the value of their underlying assets, and some questioned whether ETFs were defective products.\n\nMariana Bush, research director at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, says there was no ETF malfunction, only a misconception. She explains that an ETF's NAV is merely an estimate of underlying asset values, and that when markets go haywire and lose liquidity, those estimates become much less precise. During such periods of turmoil, \"market price, which reflects actual investing and trading, is more accurate than NAV,\" she says. Eventually, the Federal Reserve expanded its lending program to accept highly rated muni debt as collateral, which helped to bolster the liquidity and functioning of muni markets.\n\nIn the rush for safe havens, investors snapped up Treasuries but not munis. As a result, munis have become attractively priced relative to Treasuries, particularly on an after-tax basis. Mayukh Poddar, portfolio manager at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, says that in normal times, munis yield 80% to 85% of what equivalent-maturity Treasuries yield. Now munis are on offer for about 200%--and that's before the tax benefit. For instance, five- and 10-year munis recently yielded 0.89% and 1.13%, respectively, compared with just 0.36% and 0.65% for Treasuries of the same maturity. Assuming a maximum federal tax rate of 40.8%, the tax-equivalent yield for that 1.13%, 10-year muni is 1.91%.\n\nThe risks: The longer the pandemic drags on and the deeper the recession, the more state and local governments will feel financial stress. Muni sectors that will be significantly impacted, at least temporarily, include transportation (for example, airports), senior-living facilities, universities and sports arenas. A large separate issue, notes Jeff Porter, chief investment officer at Sullivan Bruyette Speros & Blayney, is that declining and rock-bottom interest rates in effect sharply increase liabilities of state and local pension funds, which were already struggling to meet investment-return requirements. The pension shortfall can lead to credit-rating cuts--and higher taxes for residents to fill the pension gap.\n\nHow to invest: National muni funds provide investors with well-diversified baskets of state and local credits from around the country. Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income (FLTMX, 1.75%) is a member of the Kiplinger 25, the list of our favorite no-load funds. Adjusted for the maximum federal tax rate, the fund's tax-equivalent yield is 3.0%. Nearly 90% of the fund's assets are in muni bonds rated A or higher. The largest sector, at last reading, was health care; the largest state exposure in the portfolio was Texas.\n\nFor Porter, a go-to muni fund is Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt Bond (VWITX, 2.03%), which has a nice habit of outperforming most actively managed muni-bond funds in most years, in part due to its low fees (0.17%). The fund has an average duration of 4.8, which implies a 4.8% loss, approximately, if interest rates were to rise by one percentage point, or a 4.8% gain if rates were to move one point in the other direction. About 70% of this index fund's bond holdings are rated double-A or triple-A. The tax-equivalent yield is 3.4%.\n\nVanguard High-Yield Tax-Exempt (VWAHX, 3.21%) is a bit of a misnomer. Only 15% of this actively managed fund's holdings are rated below investment grade; the higher yield (5.4% on a tax-equivalent basis) is due more to its allocation to long-term muni bonds. The fund's average duration is 6.2. Aided by a low fee (0.17%), the fund has outrun a peer group of national long muni bonds by about 0.7% annualized over trailing three-, five- and 10-year time periods.\n\nSEE ALSO: Investing in Gold: 10 Facts You Need to KnowInvestment-Grade Bonds\n\nThe core of a typical fixed-income portfolio is made up of investment-grade bonds issued by governments (for example, U.S. Treasuries), agencies (mortgage-backed securities, say) and corporations. In theory, these bonds should have low credit risk, but market action in recent weeks provides a textbook example of how the fortunes of investment-grade bonds can diverge in a time of crisis. Investors piled into the safe haven of U.S. Treasuries, driving up prices and pushing yields down to record-low levels. But investors exited corporate bonds, leading to a dramatic widening in the spread of their yields over Treasury yields that reflects a heightened perception of risk.\n\nThe risks: The past decade has seen enormous growth in issuance of U.S. corporate bonds with a triple-B rating, the lowest rung on the investment-grade ladder. These bonds now account for about half of the entire corporate investment-grade universe. Many triple-B bonds--especially in energy and other economy-sensitive sectors--have suffered sharp declines in value, now trade at high-yield levels and may be downgraded by the rating agencies to junk status.\n\nAndy Kapyrin, co-head of investments at RegentAtlantic, says there's a \"hard line in the sand between investment grade and high yield that a lot of investors won't cross.\" Therefore, due to investment mandates, many fund managers and other professional investors may even be required to dump triple-B bonds that are downgraded to high-yield status.\n\nHow to invest: The first decision is whether to invest in an index fund or hire an active bond manager. In today's low-yield environment, Kapyrin figures that it's difficult for active managers to earn enough extra return to compensate for their higher fees. Thus, he prefers indexing with funds such as Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond Index (VICSX, 3.3%), with a rock-bottom fee of 0.07%. For a broader approach, consider iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG, $117, 1.8%). This ETF tracks the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index and has nearly one-half of its assets in U.S. Treasury and agency bonds, one-fourth in mortgage securities, and one-fourth in corporate bonds.\n\nSullivan Bruyette CIO Porter makes a case for active managers, given today's market dislocations, which favor nimble managers quick to spot emerging opportunities. One such manager is Jeffrey Gundlach, the mortgage-security maven at DoubleLine Total Return (DLTNX, 3.1%), another Kip 25 member. DoubleLine holds agency and non-agency securities and controls volatility in part by running a portfolio with just half the duration, on average, of the Bloomberg Barclays Agg index.\n\nDodge & Cox Income (DODIX, 2.9%) invests in a broader spectrum of investment-grade bonds and levies a reasonable fee of 0.42%. Compared with the Agg index, the fund has a lower duration, a smaller weighting in Treasuries and a higher allocation to corporate bonds, as well as loans that have been pooled and securitized.\n\nSEE ALSO: 7 Best Growth ETFs to Reap the Recovery's RewardsReal Estate Investment Trusts\n\nREITs are designed to generate income for investors, as 90% of their taxable income must be distributed each year to shareholders. The creation of REITs effectively democratized real estate investing by providing individual investors with access to commercial-property projects, such as office and apartment buildings and shopping centers. You can view REITs as hybrid securities that offer bond-like yields and (in some cases) stock-like appreciation potential. REITs can be a compelling component of a diversified, long-term investment portfolio because they don't move in perfect sync with either stocks or bonds. And due to their underlying property holdings, they provide some inflation protection in periods of rising prices.\n\nThe risks: As liquid, publicly traded securities, REITs can be volatile--unlike, for instance, the price movements of your less-liquid home. In recent months, REITs plunged in value, in line with common stocks. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, containment efforts and social distancing, owners of shopping malls, cinemas, hotels and resorts, and even some office space, are suffering. Many REITs benefit from holding multiyear leases. That provides some clarity about expected cash flow, but REITs are not immune from the economic ravages of a recession.\n\nHow to invest: Realty Income Corp. (O, $52, 5.3%) owns 6,400 properties that it leases to large companies, such as Walgreens, Walmart, 7-Eleven and Fed-Ex. Realty, one of the Kiplinger Dividend 15, a list of our favorite dividend stocks, has a strong record of annually boosting dividends (which it pays monthly).\n\nEven prior to the pandemic, shopping-mall operators were being squeezed by the relentless rise of Amazon and other online-shopping websites. Although mall owners are suffering, many other REIT sectors, including self-storage facilities, rental housing, health care and technology infrastructure, are flourishing.\n\nJohn Buckingham, portfolio manager at Kovitz Investment Group and editor of The Prudent Speculator, hunts for REITs that benefit from industry tailwinds. Two of his favorites are in health care, where demand is growing in response to our aging society, and in technology. Physicians Realty Trust (DOC, $16, 5.8%) develops, owns and operates health care buildings that are leased to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. Digital Realty Trust (DLR, $149, 3.0%) owns and operates data centers around the world, which benefit from the global surge in demand for information storage and video streaming. Its yield is on the low end for REITs, but the business is growing and dividends have compounded at a nearly 6% annualized rate over the past five years.\n\nVanguard Real Estate Index (VNQ, $76, 4.6%) provides low-cost entry to a diversified portfolio of about 180 REIT securities. The ETF's largest holding is American Tower, owner and operator of wireless-communications infrastructure, followed by Prologis, a leading owner of supply-chain and logistics real estate, such as warehouses.\n\nSEE ALSO: The 10 Best REITs to Buy for 2020Dividend Stocks\n\nStocks that pay dividends can be an important income component of a diversified portfolio. Unlike fixed-income investments, many dividend-paying corporations raise their distributions each year, which provides investors with inflation protection. Preferred stocks are a kind of hybrid--the dividends they issue are fixed, akin to senior fixed-rate debt, and take priority over dividend payments to the same issuer's common-stock shareholders. Bradford Coyle, executive managing director of Steward Partners/Raymond James, argues that the bear market has created fine opportunities for equity-income investors, with high-quality stocks yielding more than investment-grade bonds and selling at bargain prices. \"These are the periods of time to plant seeds in high-quality companies trading at substantial discounts compared with what was available just weeks ago,\" he says.\n\nThe risks: The deep recession will play havoc with many companies' dividend plans, forcing some to cut, suspend or even eliminate dividend payments. Goldman Sachs projects that dividend payments for companies in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, up 9% in the first quarter of 2020, will plummet 38% from April to December 2020. An expanding list of companies, including Occidental Petroleum, Ford Motor and Boeing, have already cut or suspended dividend payments.\n\nHow to invest: In a deep recession, it makes sense to look for high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, sufficient cash, low dividend-payout ratios (dividends divided by earnings), and an ability to keep paying and ideally increasing dividends during the downturn. \"You want to ensure that you're investing in businesses that can make it through to the other side and survive the chasm,\" says Kovitz's Buckingham.\n\nAltfest's Poddar thinks Verizon Communications (VZ, $58, 4.2%), a Kiplinger Dividend 15 stock, and AT&T (T, $31, 6.7%) are firms that can keep paying solid dividends through hard times. Particularly when more Americans are working from home these days, demand should remain robust for these firms' telecom services, such as mobile telephony, internet and pay TV. If you like the stability of a utility, consider Dominion Energy (D, $82, 4.6%), a large power generator based in Richmond, Va.\n\nHealth care companies also have solid defensive characteristics that come with some growth potential, says Poddar. You can find attractive yields from pharma giants Pfizer (PFE, $37, 4.1%) and AbbVie (ABBV, $83, 5.7%), a spinoff from Abbott Labs that recently acquired Allergan. AbbVie's top drug is Humira, a blockbuster prescribed for arthritis and a host of other ailments; AbbVie, too, is a Kiplinger Dividend 15 member.\n\nBanks came into this crisis having passed stress tests and with much stronger balance sheets than they had in 2008, during the financial crisis. Find respectable yields at JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $95, 3.8%), the largest U.S. bank, measured by assets, and Wells Fargo (WFC, $28, 7.2%). One potential risk is that government regulators could ask banks to suspend dividend payments (which happened in 2008) to preserve capital for the sake of supporting the real economy; several have suspended share-buyback plans.\n\nMost preferred stocks are in the financial-services industry. With fixed dividends, they are a lower-risk way to invest in bank stocks because they stand higher on the capital-structure ladder and are less likely to suffer dividend cuts than common stocks. IShares Preferred and Income Securities (PFF, $34, 4.5%), an ETF with a 0.46% expense ratio, holds nearly 500 preferred stocks, including issues from Wells Fargo and Bank of America.\n\nSEE ALSO: 15 Super-Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy NowClosed-End Funds\n\nClosed-end funds sell a set number of shares through an initial public offering and invest the money in stocks, bonds, loans, MLPs and other types of securities. Traded on an exchange, the fund's market price, which reflects investor demand, can veer widely from the fund's underlying NAV and trade at a discount or premium.\n\nMost closed-end funds use leverage, or borrowed money, which can swell returns in bull markets but deflate them in bearish times. The funds' volatility in recent weeks has been remarkable. Wells Fargo's Bush says that before the coronavirus began infecting U.S. financial markets, the average closed-end fund traded at a slim 3% discount to NAV; by mid March, discounts were well over 20% for the first time since the financial crisis, with the average fund's price off 40%.\n\nThe risks: The use of borrowed funds to buy portfolio assets magnifies the decline in NAV of a closed-end fund relative to the overall market. If a fund's NAV declines too much, driving its leverage ratio (borrowed funds as a percentage of assets) too high, then it will run afoul of regulatory limits. Funds in this situation, which today include a number of MLP closed-end funds, will be forced to lighten their debt load by dumping assets and/or delaying or cutting dividends.\n\nHow to invest: John Cole Scott, chief investment officer of Closed-End Fund Advisors, is avoiding sectors such as MLPs, but he spots a good entry point in discounted funds with solid holdings that make prudent use of leverage. (It's cheap to borrow now!) One he thinks fits the bill is EV Senior Floating Rate (EFR, $11, 7.5%), which trades at a 14% discount to NAV. The ETF is managed by Eaton Vance and has a relatively high 39% leverage ratio. The senior loans the fund holds are higher in a company's capital structure than are high-yield issues, which implies a higher recovery rate for the fund if some loans go bad.\n\nScott's reasoning for liking Flaherty & Crumrine Dynamic Preferred & Income (DFP, $23, 7.6%) is similar. Preferred stocks are senior to common stock on the capital structure pole. The leveraged fund trades at a small discount to NAV, and top holdings include preferred shares of Citigroup, Liberty Mutual and MetLife.\n\nPatrick Galley, comanager of RiverNorth Opportunistic Municipal Income (RMI, $20, 5.4%), sees value in muni bonds, a large closed-end fund sector, given a pickup in yield compared with Treasuries. The managers can alternate between buying muni bonds or investing in muni closed-end funds; the fund is currently about 60%-40%, respectively. It trades at a 6% discount and employs a good deal of leverage.\n\nSEE ALSO: 50 Top Stock Picks That Billionaires LoveHigh-Yield Bonds\n\nHigh-yield bonds (also known as junk bonds) are issued by sub-investment-grade companies. Investors receive high yields for taking the extra risk of lending to these lower-rated businesses. But as RegentAtlantic's Kapyrin notes, until recently the market was more high risk than high yield, because actual yields were quite low. At the start of 2020, high-yield bonds yielded only 5%, and the spread over Treasury yields of similar maturity averaged only three to four percentage points.\n\nWithin weeks, yield credit spreads soared to 10 percentage points. Terri Spath, chief investment officer of Sierra Investment Management, notes that in the past, when credit spreads blew out to such levels, it heralded an attractive entry point in the high-yield bond market, implying strong future returns for brave investors. Spreads have since narrowed to between seven and eight points, but some good deals remain.\n\nThe risks: Defaults of high-yield issuers typically surge during recessions. Ray Kennedy, comanager of Hotchkis & Wiley High Yield Fund, expects the default rate to zoom from a low 2.5% in 2019 to 8%. The energy sector, which has a high weight in the junk-bond market, has been crushed by cratering oil prices; the gap in yields is nearly 20 points over Treasuries, reflecting the risk. The hotel, cruise-line and gaming sectors are also under severe stress. But keep in mind that high yields are supposed to compensate for the risk of rising defaults.\n\nHow to invest: If indexing is your preference, consider SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK, $100, 7.4%), an ETF that comes with a relatively modest annual fee of 0.40%.\n\nMany experts, such as Alex Seleznev, portfolio strategist at Councilor, Buchanan & Mitchell, prefer active managers for high-yield bonds--particularly during times of market stress, when seasoned investors can sift through the wreckage to find pearls. Seleznev likes PGIM High Yield (PHYZX, 9.4%), which invests mostly in higher-rated junk (that is, bonds rated double-B and B) and has consistently generated higher risk-adjusted returns than its underlying junk-bond index.\n\nVanguard High-Yield Corporate (VWEHX, 6.5%), a Kip 25 fund, also tilts away from \"junkier\" junk, charges a low fee of 0.23% and has held up relatively well in this year's market carnage. This is an actively managed fund, with Wellington Management as the sub-adviser. Most of the bonds in the portfolio of Osterweis Strategic Income (OSTIX, 6.5%) mature within three years, which explains why its average bond duration of 1.2 is less than half that of the index and its volatility is relatively low. Lead manager Carl Kaufman entered 2020 in a defensive posture, with a big cash hoard, but is now playing offense.\n\nSEE ALSO: 19 Dividend Aristocrats That Have Gone on Deep Discount\n\nEDITOR'S PICKS\n\n50 Top Stock Picks That Billionaires Love\n\n19 Dividend Aristocrats That Have Gone on Deep Discount\n\nVanguard Equity Income Wrestles with Dividend Cuts\n\nCopyright 2020 The Kiplinger Washington Editors", "uri": "6060720342", "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/32-ways-earn-9-money-163747083.html"}], "6060415628": [508501944, {"sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "published_on": "2020-05-08T12:08:00Z", "name": "White Mountains Insurance : Reports First Quarter Results | MarketScreener", "dtype": "news", "pk": 508501944, "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, May 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (NYSE: WTM) reported book value per share of $981 and adjusted book value per share of $980 as of March 31, 2020. Book value per share and adjusted book value per share both decreased 4% in the first quarter of 2020, including dividends.\n\nManning Rountree, CEO, commented, \"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses has been varied so far. Overall, ABVPS was down -4% for the quarter, driven primarily by a -4.6% return on our investment portfolio. BAM had a good quarter, driven by abundant secondary market activity. NSM also posted good results, growing the top line 4% quarter over quarter and closing the Kingsbridge acquisition in early April. Kudu reported a net loss for the quarter, as operating profits were more than offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses. MediaAlpha had yet another record quarter, driven by higher volumes in its insurance verticals. The global slowdown in travel activity caused a significant decline in premiums and revenues at PassportCard/DavidShield; in May we invested $15 million to support operations and to continue global expansion. During the quarter, we repurchased $54 million of shares at an average price of $844. We ended the quarter with $0.8 billion of undeployed capital and ample liquidity. I am proud of how our team has responded to these unprecedented challenges. Through their efforts, we remain open for business, operating remotely at all levels, and not missing a beat.\"\n\nComprehensive loss attributable to common shareholders was $132 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to comprehensive income attributable to common shareholders of $284 million in the first quarter of 2019. The results in the first quarter of 2019 include $182 million of realized and unrealized gains from MediaAlpha's sale of a significant minority stake to Insignia Capital Group on February 26, 2019 (the \"MediaAlpha Transaction\").\n\nHG Global/BAM\n\nBAM's gross written premiums and member surplus contributions (MSC) collected were $20 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $16 million in the first quarter of 2019. BAM insured municipal bonds with par value of $3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Total pricing was 66 basis points in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 83 basis points in the first quarter of 2019. BAM's total claims paying resources were $930 million at March 31, 2020, compared to $938 million at December 31, 2019 and $878 million at March 31, 2019. The reduction in claims paying resources primarily related to a January 2020 cash payment of $65 million on the BAM surplus notes, of which $16 million flowed outside the regulatory trusts included in BAM's claims paying resources.\n\nSe\u00e1n McCarthy, CEO of BAM, said, \"We saw strong investor demand for insured bonds throughout the quarter, even as market conditions shifted dramatically between January 1 and the end of March. Primary market activity came to an effective halt in March in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, but BAM continued to see good opportunities in the secondary market throughout the quarter, particularly in March as credit fundamentals came back into focus. In April, the primary market began to reopen while the secondary market remained active. We are building a large pipeline of approved and awarded new-issues that we expect to execute as markets stabilize. The pandemic is impacting the finances of municipalities to varying degrees, and, over time, financial stress could emerge. BAM's existing credit portfolio is of high quality and structured to be resilient during economic slowdowns. To date, the portfolio is performing as expected: 100% of BAM-insured bond payments were made through May 1.\"\n\nHG Global reported pre-tax income of $11 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to pre-tax income of $16 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by lower investment returns. White Mountains reported pre-tax loss related to BAM of $10 million in both the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2019.\n\nBAM is a mutual insurance company that is owned by its members. BAM's results are consolidated into White Mountains's GAAP financial statements and attributed to non-controlling interests.\n\nNSM\n\nNSM reported pre-tax loss of $1 million, adjusted EBITDA of $11 million, and commission and other revenues of $65 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to pre-tax loss of $2 million, adjusted EBITDA of $10 million, and commission and other revenues of $49 million in the first quarter of 2019. Results for the first quarter of 2020 include the results of Embrace Pet Insurance, which NSM acquired on April 1, 2019.\n\nGeof McKernan, CEO of NSM, said, \"NSM delivered another good quarter. Trailing 12 months pro forma controlled premiums grew 4% quarter over quarter to $952 million, while pro forma adjusted EBITDA declined 3% to $49 million, reflecting continued investment in the business. During the quarter, we enjoyed particularly strong growth in the real estate, specialty transportation and pet verticals, offset by a decline in the U.K. vertical. Looking forward, we could see some softness emerge in certain verticals in the coming quarters, but we do not currently anticipate dramatic impacts over the fullness of time.\"\n\nOn April 7, 2020, NSM acquired 100% of the equity of Kingsbridge Group Limited, the leading provider of commercial lines insurance and consulting services to the U.K.'s high growth contingent workforce.\n\nKudu\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Kudu reported pre-tax loss of $21 million and adjusted EBITDA of $6 million. Pre-tax loss included a $25 million unrealized loss on Kudu's participation contracts, reflecting the impact of the market dislocation on Kudu's underlying asset management firms.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Kudu deployed $21 million in Creation Investments Capital Management, a private equity firm specializing in impact investing. Kudu has now deployed a total of $288 million in ten investment management firms with combined assets under management of approximately $33 billion, spanning a range of asset classes, including real estate, real assets, wealth management, hedge funds, private equity and alternative credit strategies.\n\nRob Jakacki, CEO of Kudu, said, \"The Kudu portfolio held up reasonably well relative to broader markets in the first quarter, in large part reflecting our conscious portfolio diversification across asset classes. We estimate that in the quarter, on a same store basis, AUM declined 7% and modeled annualized revenue declined 12%. We were pleased to close our investment in Creation, adding another talented private capital manager to the portfolio. We have now deployed $288 million across ten firms with an average cash yield to Kudu at inception of 10.4%. Our capital position remains solid, with healthy cash flows from the portfolio and $225 million of new capital raised at the end of last year. We are optimistic about the deal prospects ahead of us this year.\"\n\nOther Operations\n\nWhite Mountains's Other Operations segment reported pre-tax loss of $144 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to pre-tax gain of $283 million in the first quarter of 2019. The results for the first quarter of 2020 were driven primarily by $138 million of net realized and unrealized investment losses, while the results for the first quarter of 2019 were driven primarily by $182 million of realized and unrealized gains from the MediaAlpha Transaction and $119 million of net realized and unrealized investment gains. General and administrative expenses decreased to $18 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $29 million in the first quarter of 2019, driven primarily by a reduction in incentive compensation costs.\n\nShare Repurchases\n\nFor the first quarter of 2020, White Mountains repurchased and retired 64,403 of its common shares for $54 million at an average share price of $843.79, or 86% of White Mountains's March 31, 2020 adjusted book value per share.\n\nInvestments\n\nThe total return on invested assets was -4.6% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 10.1% in the first quarter of 2019, which included $115 million in unrealized investment gains from the MediaAlpha Transaction. Excluding the MediaAlpha Transaction, the total return on invested assets was 5.7% in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nMark Plourde, Managing Director of White Mountains Advisors, said, \"The total portfolio returned -4.6% in the first quarter. The main event was the sharp decline in the equity markets. Common stocks and ETFs returned -20.9%, lagging the S&P 500 return of -19.6%. Other long-term investments returned -0.9%. This result included a $25 million decrease in the fair value of Kudu's participation contracts, a $10 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in PassportCard/DavidShield and a $30 million increase in the fair value of our investment in MediaAlpha. Fixed income returned 0.7%, lagging the BBIA Index return of 2.5%, primarily due to the short duration positioning of our portfolio.\"\n\nAdditional Information\n\nWhite Mountains is a Bermuda-domiciled financial services holding company traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock Exchange under the symbol WTM.

that have been reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nAdjusted book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure which is derived by adjusting (i) the GAAP book value per share numerator and (ii) the common shares outstanding denominator, as described below.\n\nThe GAAP book value per share numerator is adjusted (i) to include a discount for the time value of money arising from the modeled timing of cash payments of principal and interest on the BAM surplus notes and (ii) to add back the unearned premium reserve, net of deferred acquisition costs, at HG Global.\n\nUnder GAAP, White Mountains is required to carry the BAM surplus notes, including accrued interest, at nominal value with no consideration for time value of money. Based on a debt service model that forecasts operating results for BAM through maturity of the surplus notes, the present value of the BAM surplus notes, including accrued interest, was estimated to be $154 million, $157 million and $143 million less than the nominal GAAP carrying values as of March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.\n\nThe value of HG Global's unearned premium reserve, net of deferred acquisition costs, was $121 million, $119 million and $108 million as of March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 respectively.\n\nWhite Mountains believes these adjustments are useful to management and investors in analyzing the intrinsic value of HG Global, including the value of the surplus notes and the value of the in-force business at HG Re, HG Global's reinsurance subsidiary.\n\nThe denominator used in the calculation of adjusted book value per share equals the number of common shares outstanding adjusted to exclude unearned restricted common shares, the compensation cost of which, at the date of calculation, has yet to be amortized. Restricted common shares are earned on a straight-line basis over their vesting periods. The reconciliation of GAAP book value per share to adjusted book value per share is included on page 6.\n\nGross written premiums and MSC from new business is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is derived by adjusting gross written premiums and MSC collected (i) to include the present value of future installment MSC not yet collected and (ii) to exclude the impact of gross written premium adjustments related to policies closed in prior periods. White Mountains believes these adjustments are useful to management and investors in evaluating the volume and pricing of new business closed during the period. The reconciliation from GAAP gross written premiums to gross written premiums and MSC from new business is included on page 12.\n\nNSM's EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and pro forma adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes interest expense on debt, income tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization from GAAP net income (loss).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain other items in GAAP net income (loss) in addition to those excluded from EBITDA. The adjustments relate to (i) change in fair value of contingent consideration earnout liabilities, (ii) acquisition-related transaction expenses, (iii) fair value purchase accounting adjustment for deferred revenue, (iv) investments made in the development of new business lines and (v) restructuring expenses. A description of each follows:\n\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration earnout liabilities - Earnout liabilities are amounts payable to the sellers of businesses purchased by NSM that are contingent on the earnings of such businesses in periods subsequent to their acquisition. Under GAAP, earnout liabilities are not capitalized as part of the purchase price. Earnout liabilities are recorded at fair value, with the periodic change in the fair value of these liabilities recorded as income or an expense. Acquisition-related transaction expenses - Represents costs directly related to NSM's transactions to acquire businesses, such as transaction-related compensation, impairments of intangible assets, banking, accounting and external lawyer fees, which are not capitalized and are expensed under GAAP. Fair value purchase accounting adjustment for deferred revenue - Represents the amount of deferred revenue that had already been collected but subsequently written down in connection with establishing the fair value of deferred revenue as part of NSM's purchase accounting for Embrace Pet Insurance. Investments made in the development of new business lines - Represents the net loss related to the start-up of newly established lines of business, which NSM views as investments. For the periods presented, this adjustment relates primarily to NSM's investment expenditures, net of revenues generated, in the organic development of (i) its pet insurance line and (ii) its MGA in the United Kingdom. NSM has recently decided to cease investment in the organic development of its pet insurance line and, instead, to acquire Embrace Pet Insurance, which closed in April 2019. Restructuring expenses - Represents expenses associated with eliminating redundant work force and facilities that often arise as a result of NSM's post-acquisition integration strategies.\n\nPro forma adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that starts with adjusted EBITDA and also includes the earnings of acquired businesses for the period of time over the previous twelve months that the businesses were not owned by White Mountains.\n\nWhite Mountains believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating NSM's performance. White Mountains also believes that pro forma adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors to demonstrate the earnings profile of NSM's business as of the end of the period for a full 12 month period. See page 13 for the reconciliation of NSM's GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and pro forma adjusted EBITDA.\n\nKudu's EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and annualized adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes interest expense on debt, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets from GAAP net income (loss).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain other items in GAAP net income (loss) in addition to those excluded from EBITDA. The adjustments relate to (i) acquisition related transaction expenses, (ii) non-cash equity-based compensation expense and (iii) unrealized (gains) losses on Kudu's revenue and earnings participation contracts. A description of each adjustment follows:\n\nAcquisition-related transaction expenses - Represents costs directly related to Kudu's transactions to acquire revenue and earnings participation contracts, such as external lawyer, banker, consulting and placement agent fees, which are not capitalized and are expensed under GAAP. Non-cash equity based compensation - Represents non-cash expenses related to Kudu's management compensation that are settled with equity units in Kudu. Unrealized (gains) and losses - Represents unrealized gains and losses recorded on Kudu's revenue and earnings participation contracts, which are recorded at fair value under GAAP.\n\nAnnualized adjusted EBITDA annualizes revenues related to Kudu's earnings and revenue participation contracts that were in place as of the end of the 12 month period but were not in effect for the full 12 month period. The amount added was calculated on a contract-by-contract basis by annualizing the revenues received for the partial 12 month period. For example, if a participation contract was in effect for four months, the amount added equals twice that amount.\n\nWhite Mountains believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating Kudu's performance. White Mountains also believes that annualized adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors to demonstrate the earnings profile of Kudu's business as of the end of the period for a full 12 month period. See page 14 for the reconciliation of Kudu's GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and annualized adjusted EBITDA.\n\nTotal consolidated portfolio return excluding the MediaAlpha Transaction is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the $115 million pre-tax unrealized investment gain resulting from the MediaAlpha Transaction recognized in the first quarter of 2019. White Mountains believes this measure to be useful to management and investors by making the return in the prior period comparable to the current period. A reconciliation from GAAP to the reported percentage is as follows:\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2019\n\nGAAP return\n\nRemove\n\nMediaAlpha\n\nTransaction\n\nReturn - excluding\n\nMediaAlpha\n\nTransaction\n\nTotal consolidated portfolio returns\n\n10.1\n\n%\n\n(4.4)\n\n%\n\n5.7\n\n%\n\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n\nThis earnings release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

For example, the Whiskey rebellion of 1791 led to a contest between Alexander Hamilton's Treasury and individual states, and his ultimately successful resolution of the crisis paved the foundation of the American financial system.\n\nStates diverging\n\nAmidst the global economic carnage caused by the coronavirus crisis, many (mostly in London and New York) expect the euro system to face another existential crisis. Though European politicians have generally failed to learn the lessons of past euro crises in that many reforms have not been executed, the euro and EU are more robust than many think.\n\nWhile the euro is not yet as credible as the dollar, the surprise in coming months may be that America begins to look more like Europe.\n\nGovernors to the fore\n\nThink of it this way. Governors of individual states have never enjoyed such prominence, with for example the governor of California referring to it as a 'nation-state'. A recent FT survey showed that individual governors are more trusted than the President. In this respect the state governors are like the prime ministers of European countries.\n\nIn addition, American states are grouping together to form pacts to coordinate the ending of the lockdown (in Europe it is similar). Unlike Europe though, the political leaning of states is also a determining factor in the speed with which they are reopening, as is the President's political and fiscal treatment of them. In time, this will make states more distinct economically and politically, and less united.\n\nCredit crunch\n\nThe decisive factor may be the impending credit crunch. We are now moving past both the initial financial shock of the coronavirus crisis, and the comfort of the financial morphine as provided by the Fed and Congress is wearing off. Yet, there is now much less that both the Federal Reserve and Treasury can do to forestall the closure of hundreds of thousands of businesses across America.\n\nAgainst this backdrop investors are pointing to a growing widening of bond spreads for municipal bonds, and the rhetoric surrounding New Jersey and Illinois echoes with the way Italy and Greece are spoken of. Oil sensitive states may soon also come under pressure.\n\nAs the finances of individual states deteriorate, so too will be the expectation of support (bond buying by the Fed), and then, the moral hazard arguments that many in Europe deploy to sanction ECB buying of periphery debt, will resonate in the US.\n\nNegative rates\n\nIt is also worth noting that like Japan and Europe in recent years, financial markets have just started to price in negative interest rates in the US (for next January), something that could rattle consumers and its banking sector.\n\nPerhaps the worst thing this virus can do to America, beyond the human tragedy, is to increase the disparity of economic circumstances across states. In a country with extreme wealth inequality and an incomprehensible gap between sharply rising unemployment and a loft stock market, 'intra-state inequality' may grow. Migration between states and the current system of federal transfers will not be sufficient to balance this out.\n\nInfrastructure Europe style\n\nHere, Europe is worth a look. One of the great achievements of the European Union has been the way it has funded infrastructure investment in relatively poorer countries. Americans visiting Ireland will be familiar with the 'funded by the EU signposts'.\n\nThe lesson for America is that at a time when transport, telecoms and educational infrastructure needs to be badly upgraded, this should be done in a way that helps to equalize rather than exacerbate the differences between states.

The last thing one wants is to make these medium and small firms borrow more and emerge out of the Covid-19 crisis with unsustainable debt levels.By Apoorva Javadekar\n\nExtended lockdowns do not bode well for Indian economy, and more so for corporate sector, given that corporate growth numbers have been weak for at least the last couple of years, credit markets are broken, and balance sheet liquidity is constrained.\n\nThis concern is reflected by India Inc's appeal to GoI in this paper on Thursday to put the economy and jobs in central focus while adapting to Covid-19 conditions.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already announced multiple steps to help the corporate sector. This includes a three-month moratorium on all types of loans, reduction of the repo rate -- which, hopefully, will bring down the lending rates as well -- and reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) that leaves extra cash on the table for banks to lend to corporates.\n\nBut, as is now apparent, banks are charging a substantial interest cost on the moratorium option. More importantly, if many firms opt for moratorium, banks will face cash-flow disruptions over next three months. This means that the moratorium scheme offsets a meaningful fraction of excess liquidity that RBI created via reduction in CRR.\n\nIn other words, the current RBI policy mainly works on intensive margin -- by extending the maturity and credit to already existing loans. But what about extensive margin -- firms who want to borrow fresh to ride out the liquidity crises?\n\nReduced repo rates do not help much either, as marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR)/bank lending rates have not moved much since the announcements. Also, it's a blanket moratorium -- effectively also helping zombie firms in the process, perhaps at the cost of good firms.\n\nClearly, we need to direct credit to more efficient firms that have the capacity to absorb more debt. Surprisingly, compared to the onset of the 2008 crises, large Indian corporates today have de-levered substantially. The debt-to-equity ratio for all listed firms -- as covered by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy's (CMIE) Prowess database -- stands at about 21% today, compared to 32% in 2008.\n\nThe picture for non-listed firms isn't so good, with leverage rising to 43% from 37% in 2008. The last thing one wants is to make these medium and small firms borrow more and emerge out of the Covid-19 crisis with unsustainable debt levels.\n\nOtherwise, we are looking at the repeat of aftermath of 2008 crises, where the banking system flood the market with undirected credit bazooka that set the stage for non-performing assets (NPA) crises.\n\nHence, data-driven solution demands that majority of new credit be directed at large borrowers, perhaps with a condition that part of the credit is utilised to help smaller suppliers -- maybe by asking firms to buyout smaller ones and maintain the supply chain, or ask them to reduce the payment time for orders.\n\nThis way, liquidity reaches the bottom of the pyramid, but debt remains on the healthy balance sheet. For smaller firms, we need less, not more, credit.\n\nFor example, a small firm's current debt should be written off on the condition it keeps its employees or keeps paying wages. This is what the US is implementing via Paycheck Protection Program -- smaller firms getting a write-down of 2.5 times their monthly wage bill.\n\nWe also need a more direct form of intervention in credit markets, like the one used by the US Federal Reserve. The Fed has virtually agreed to buy all type of bonds, including government and municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, new and existing corporate bonds and commercial papers of large rated firms (primary and secondary market corporate credit facility), bonds backed by small-business administration and, as announced on March 23, even lower-rated junk bonds.\n\nIn some cases, the Fed is buying and executing trades via a special purpose vehicle (SPV) where it can't invest directly by law. The crux of the matter is that fresh credit directly flows to the targeted sectors and companies bypassing the banking sector.\n\nA stressed banking sector laden with NPAs as in India, will be hesitant to lend despite having good liquidity. In fact, banks will be happier to invest in the government securities (g-sec) market, crowding out corporate credit.\n\nSo, it is important that excess liquidity released to the banks should have been conditioned on investing in the corporate bond market, or even in equities of these financially sound firms, if RBI wanted to route the policy via the banking sector.\n\nThe only move that does this somewhat now is banks categorising corporate bonds as held-to-maturity, instead of mark-to-market, that immunises banks from writing down market losses immediately.\n\nWe need more credit, healthy credit, and credit that is utilised efficiently.\n\nThe writer is assistant professor, finance, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad", "uri": "6059540739", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/view-a-data-driven-rescue-mission-for-the-economy/articleshow/75609134.cms"}], "6059326396": [164695698, {"sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "published_on": "2020-05-07T14:42:00Z", "name": "New York MTA chief warms to MAC-style bond issuance", "dtype": "news", "pk": 164695698, "text": "The suggestion that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority sell tax-free municipal bonds in smaller denominations akin to what New York did in the 1970s is \"a very interesting idea,\" Chairman Patrick Foye said Wednesday.\n\n\"It's one that we're looking at,\" Foye said during a teleconference sponsored by the business group Association for a Better New York, responding to a question from Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Rudin Center for Transportation and Management.\n\nIn the 1970s, with the city shut off from the credit markets and on the verge of bankruptcy, the state created the Municipal Assistance Corp. to issue debt on its behalf. MAC sold bonds in denominations of $1,000 and issued $10 billion overall before its dissolution in September 2008, when all the debt was paid.\n\nToday it's the MTA facing a fiscal crisis amid a pandemic that has chased away most of its riders and the farebox revenue they generate.\n\n\"Since low interest is the case now, what if we went for a low-denomination, tax-free MTA bond?\" Moss asked. \"I think you could capture enormous goodwill across the city and state if you gave every rider, every commuter a chance to invest in the MTA and get a good coupon, far better than you can get at JPMorgan Chase, for example.\"\n\nNYU Rudin is finalizing a report suggesting the MTA issue tax-free bonds in denominations of $2,500 or $5,000 to help raise needed revenue.\n\n\"The riders as well as the investment bankers on Park Avenue deserve to benefit from the MTA's financing in the next five years. Let every New Yorker, not just the wealthy, earn 5% tax-free interest on their savings,\" Moss said.\n\nThe state-run MTA operates the mass transit system in metropolitan New York and is one of the largest municipal bond issuers with roughly $45 billion of debt including special credits.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership is down 92% on its subways and similarly for its buses and commuter rail lines.\n\nIn addition, the need for massive cleaning and disinfecting its system, and related overtime, will add \"hundreds of millions\" to operating costs, Foye added. The MTA this week began its first planned shutdown of subway service in its 115 years, closing the system from 1 to 5 a.m. the past two nights for cleaning.\n\nA report by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. said the MTA stands to lose up to $8.5 billion this calendar year. MTA officials, which received nearly $4 billion through the federal CARES Act, have requested a further $3.9 billion from Washington.\n\nAccording to Foye, 109 employees have died from the virus as of Wednesday.\n\n\"Obviously the MAC experience is well-known to Bob [Foran] and to me and to Janno [Lieber] and others,\" Foye said. \"That is also on the table and could be part of a portfolio of ideas put together. Everything is on the table.\"\n\nForan and Lieber are the MTA's chief financial officer and capital construction chief, respectively.\n\nAs a tradeoff for the MAC bailout, the city has had to balance its budget, use generally accepted accounting principles and prepare five-year spending plans. It submits its budgets to a separate agency, the New York State Financial Control Board.\n\nMoody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings have downgraded the MTA's transportation revenue bonds, its main borrowing vehicle. Kroll Bond Rating Agency placed the MTA's credits on watch for a downgrade. Moody's rates the bonds A2 while Fitch and S&P rate them A-plus and A-minus, respectively. Kroll assigns its AA-plus rating.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the MTA's anticipated $700 million pricing was upsized to $1.125 billion and completed at spreads about 300 basis points north of AAA benchmark yields.\n\n\"The MTA is too important to the New York State and U.S. economies for the state to let fail,\" Municipal Market Analytics said in a commentary.\n\nAccording to data on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's EMMA website, a block of Series 2013E transportation revenue bonds maturing in 2043 that originally priced at 125.005 cents on the dollar and a 5% coupon sold to a customer Wednesday night at a price of 100.658 cents and a 5.175% yield.\n\nFoye said the next federal rescue round is the most essential short-term need.\n\n\"That will eliminate significant pressure not only on our operating budget, but the capital program as well,\" he said.", "uri": "6059326396", "url": "https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/new-york-mta-chief-warms-small-denomination-bond-proposal"}], "6058794737": [990781533, {"sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "published_on": "2020-05-07T06:34:00Z", "name": "A Win-Win Moment Dawns for a New Bond Market", "dtype": "news", "pk": 990781533, "text": "The pandemic may finally prompt U.K. local authorities to tap the capital markets for funds.\n\nIt took six years for the U.K. Municipal Bonds Authority to make its capital markets debut, with its first bond sale arriving in March. The pace, though, could be about to accelerate. As the pandemic squeezes local governments already strapped for cash, there's a renewed impetus to establish a fully-fledged U.K. muni market to provide a quasi-sovereign alternative to government gilts.\n\nMany other countries already have thriving regional debt markets, including Germany, Italy and Spain. In the U.S., the muni market is worth more than $4 trillion. Thus far, efforts to establish a similar borrowing venue in the U.K. have faltered.\n\nThat failure stems partly from a 30-year-old legal case. When the courts ruled that the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham had exceeded its statutory authority by dabbling in interest-rate swaps, banks had to unwind billions of pounds worth of derivatives contracts with more than 130 similar counterparties. The capital markets instantly became off-limits to local councils -- and lawyers tend to have very, very long memories.\n\nThe U.K.'s centralized fiscal powers have also made it difficult for local governments to develop bond-issuing skills, given the paucity of taxes they're allowed to levy. Devolving fiscal authority away from Westminster has been a slow process, spurred in part by Scotland and Wales demanding more control over tax-and-spend policies as they threatened to become independent nations.\n\nIn 2014, things started to look promising. A parliamentary committee said it supported transferring some tax-raising and spending powers to local authorities, allowing them to borrow to invest in infrastructure projects. And the Local Government Association set up the U.K. Municipal Bonds Association, or MBA, with 56 local authorities becoming shareholders. Then politics got in the way, including three general elections, a Scottish independence referendum and then the Brexit vote.\n\nThat's why it took until March for the MBA to sell its first bond. That first issue comprised 350 million pounds ($438 million) of five-year floating-rate notes on behalf of Lancashire County Council. The agency's next step is to offer pooled bond issues whereby several local authorities team up to borrow; Westminster City Council and Barnsley Borough Council have already signed up to the plan.\n\nThere's the potential for the U.K. muni market to exceed 100 billion pounds, depending on the yields investors demand for taking on quasi-government credit risk, says Christian Wall of PFM Financial Advisers LLC, a Philadelphia-based public finance consultant that's advising MBA. It's an enticing proposition, he says, given that no local authority has defaulted on a debt since the establishment of the first one, the Corporation of London, in 1067.\n\nEven before the pandemic closed down most of the economy, local councils faced a funding pinch, hamstrung by years of austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis. In the past decade, central government funding of local authorities has declined by almost 60%, according to a 2019 report by the LGA. It predicted a funding gap that would climb to 8 billion pounds by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. And that was before the coronavirus increased the need to expand care for the elderly, the homeless and the disabled.\n\nThe renewed enthusiasm among U.K. local authorities to tap the capital markets comes after the government raised the cost of money supplied by their traditional financing source, an agency called the Public Works Loan Board. In October, the Treasury raised the premium over gilts on those loans by 100 basis points, to 1.8 percentage points, in an effort to deter councils from borrowing cash to invest in income-generating properties often located outside of their regional boundaries.\n\nThe surprise increase shows how local government remains at \"the whim of Whitehall\" when it comes to borrowing, so the MBA provides a welcome alternative, says Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit.\n\nThe debut MBA bond's initial quarterly interest rate was 81 basis points below the variable rate charged by the state agency PWLB at the time of issue. Even at current ultra-low yields, that represents a handy potential cost saving for councils that choose to allow the muni agency to issue bonds on their behalf.\n\nA U.K. muni market should be a win-win evolution. On the supply side, there's no question local authorities will need to borrow more. Their income from amenities such as public sports grounds, swimming pools and car parks is melting just when they need to provide more assistance to the vulnerable. On the demand side, pension funds and other asset managers would welcome a bond-market alternative to the flood of gilt supply that's coming as the government funds its various business-support projects.

They're causing a steep drop in tax revenue for state and local governments.\n\nTo ensure the flow of credit to these cash-strapped governments, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a previously unthinkable act: creating up to $500 billion in new fiat currency and lending it directly to states, cities, and counties through its Municipal Liquidity Facility.\n\nFor now, this staves off default by local governments on existing debt and allows government services to continue uninterrupted. However, this marks a dramatic departure from the Federal Reserve's traditional role of equipping solvent financial institutions with the liquidity necessary to meet credit demands.\n\nUnusual times often call for unusual measures. But this unprecedented action brings with it very serious risks -- ones that are easy to overlook.\n\nTo see why, start with an obvious fact: A bailout of municipal governments -- whether through grants, purchasing outstanding debt, or direct lending -- shifts the fiscal burden away from the municipality to taxpayers nationally. This reality is quite clear if the federal government directly funds the bailout. The public intuitively understands that federal tax revenue is either confiscated from the earnings of citizens or borrowed from our future with interest attached. Legislators openly debate the bailout proposal and must vote to appropriate funds. Ultimately, the transparency allows constituents to hold their representatives accountable.\n\nOn the other hand, spending (lending) by the central bank of newly created fiat money is far less politically problematic. Cranking up the printing presses to fund a bailout requires no immediate tax hikes, minimal official federal spending increases, and little legislative involvement. It therefore more easily slips under the political radar.\n\nFor instance, Congress facilitated the municipal bailout now underway by simply allocating $35 billion to a Special Purpose Vehicle (\"SPV\") to backstop the $500 billion in new fiat currency lent by the Federal Reserve. Ironically, the SPV itself was financed indirectly by the central bank which purchases government debt in exchange for newly created fiat money.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, this program implements the infrastructure for a future massive bailout of poorly managed governments. The day of reckoning for municipal governments was quickly approaching even before the coronavirus slowdown. Large increases in real per capita spending along with underfunded public sector pension plans constitute financial time bombs. Only a combination of higher taxes, pension reform, or diminished essential government services -- such as emergency medical responses and functioning mass transit -- will defuse the situation unless local politicians can shift these burdens onto the shoulders of unsuspecting citizens elsewhere.\n\nOf course, some concentrated winners would emerge from this larger bailout. Municipal bond investors would continue to enjoy the tax-free income from investments -- but now improved thanks to being implicitly guaranteed by the central bank. State and local politicians could curry favor by delaying painful spending cuts or governmental reforms. Public sector unions and employees would applaud a continuation of outsized pay and cushy retirement benefits.\n\nSuch a bailout creates severe economic risks. Longer term, these newly created dollars threaten to increase inflation. The $500 billion spent on municipal debt multiplies into trillions of additional dollars as the funds are deposited at lending institutions and loaned to other borrowers. A greater quantity of money chases existing resources operates as a stealth tax by eroding real savings, diminishing real wages, and driving up the cost of living.\n\nBut so long as productivity increases at a faster pace than inflation, the general public fails to realize this negative impact. Inflation denies business owners, investors, and workers from enjoying the full value of productivity created by the combination of innovation and capital investment. Much of the public simply fails to connect the dots between the gusher of new currency and a dollar consistently declining in value. The more the Federal Reserve engages in this type of money creation and asset purchase program, the more difficult the cleanup process later.\n\nNow that the Federal Reserve is actively engaged in creating new fiat currency to fund state and local governments, Congress must step in. These new tools can easily be scaled up to provide a multi-trillion dollar municipal bailout. Pressure is already on the Federal Reserve to go much further. For instance, House Financial Services Committee Chair Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) wants the central bank to buy up an array of municipal debt -- presumably including junk bonds. Others desire a bailout by the central bank of woefully underfunded public pension plans through the purchase of pension obligation bonds.\n\nPension obligation bonds are a gamble -- using borrowed funds to invest in the stock market and hoping to earn a higher rate of return than the government has to pay on the bonds. Puerto Rico tried that in 2009 right before the stock market tanked, causing funding to deteriorate instead of improve, and pushing the U.S. territory closer to bankruptcy. Unless Congress thinks it is a sound strategy to issue $10 trillion in new debt and invest taxpayers' money in the stock market in hopes of achieving high returns to reduce its total debt, the Federal Reserve should not purchase pension obligation bonds.\n\nImportantly, although existing law limits emergency Federal Reserve lending to only \"solvent\" institutions, the central bank appears ready to flout this rule. Illinois, a state notorious for its backlog of more than $7 billion in unpaid bills and barely $1 million in cash reserves (in addition to its long-term unfunded liabilities), will be one of the many recipients of short-term credit over the next few months. The rating agencies currently rate Illinois' bonds only a notch above junk.\n\nCongress should proactively roll back the authority of the Federal Reserve to directly or indirectly provide credit to state and local governments. A good starting point would be consideration of theproposed State and Local Pensions Accountability and Security Act (HR 2126) which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from providing public pension bailouts or other financial assistance. Without these statutory revisions, the Federal Reserve conceivably could directly purchase longer-term municipal debt in an \"exigent\" or \"emergency circumstances.\"\n\nThis pandemic-spurred $500 billion bailout should be a wakeup call. If Congress chooses to bailout municipal governments -- as ill-advisable as that would be -- it should utilize its constitutional spending authority rather than abdicate responsibility to an opaque, economically dangerous fiat money creation process at the Federal Reserve. As former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke stated when explaining his opposition to Fed bailouts of municipal bonds, \"This is really a political, fiscal issue.\"\n\nIt is impossible for the Federal Reserve to maintain its monetary policy independence while pursing these politically motivated bailouts. This is an off-budget trick which allows elected officials to skirt responsibility as voters are confused by the smoke and mirrors.", "uri": "6058428716", "url": "https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2020/05/02/a_backdoor_central_bank_bailout_of_state_governments_490609.html"}], "6058095862": [473069980, {"sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "published_on": "2020-05-06T15:38:00Z", "name": "With Federal Aid Uncertain, Illinois and New York's MTA Test Muni Market", "dtype": "news", "pk": 473069980, "text": "By Matt Wirz\n\nTwo of the country's largest municipal borrowers asked investors to buy bonds this week, a key test of the $3.8 trillion market where state and local governments turn to fund themselves.\n\nIllinois and New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority have been marketing about $3 billion of bonds in recent days -- the state to help plug budget holes and the authority to repay debt that is coming due. The MTA found plenty of investors willing to buy bonds Tuesday, but the debt came at a high cost, and it remains unclear how Illinois's deal will pan out, investors and analysts said.\n\nFinancial instability in state and local governments has become a national political issue during the coronavirus pandemic, with both President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) questioning bailouts of municipal entities. The reception for the two deals highlights uncertainty about how long the pandemic's economic fallout will last, how much assistance will be made available for municipal borrowers and which ones will be eligible to receive it.\n\n\"How these two deals play out will influence the whole low-investment-grade tier in the market,\" said John Miller, head of municipal-bond investing at Nuveen LLC, which manages about $180 billion of municipal bond portfolios.\n\nThe pandemic has split municipal borrowers into haves and have-nots. Relatively safe issuers like Sacramento's municipal electric utility sold bonds at relatively low interest rates in recent days while others paid dearly, or didn't bother coming to market at all.\n\nThe MTA found buyers for more than $1 billion of bonds on Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said, paying an unusually high interest rate to attract the investor interest. Still, the transaction proved the state-owned operator of New York City subway trains could refinance its obligations in public markets despite a 93% decline in ridership.\n\nThe authority delayed the deal in March when municipal bond markets shut down as Covid-19 spread, then again last week after the State of New York announced it would cut aid for the transit system. The authority agreed to pay a yield of 5.25% on some of the new bonds, compared with the roughly 2% investors demanded to own comparable debt in March, according to data from Electronic Municipal Market Access.\n\nStrong investor demand allowed the MTA to boost the size of one of its bonds to $1.125 billion from the $672 million initially planned, a person familiar with the matter said. A separate $250 million bond was also issued, the person said.\n\nIllinois tentatively planned to issue $1.2 billion of short-term debt today and $1 billion of longer term bonds shortly thereafter but the first portion of the deal \"has been delayed a bit,\" said a spokeswoman for Illinois's budget office.\n\nThe state was grappling with budget deficits, high pension costs and a shrinking population even before the pandemic shutdowns and its borrowing costs have soared in their wake. The yield of an Illinois bond due in 2028 has doubled since January to 5.2%, according to data from Electronic Municipal Market Access.\n\n\"Illinois is going to be the front line of the trouble in municipal bond markets,\" said Bob Brinker, publisher of a bond investing newsletter for individual investors, who is recommending they stay away from the state and other riskier municipal bonds.\n\nThe governor's office is projecting an up to $7.4 billion budget deficit next year and the state has the largest pension shortfall in the nation, pegged at $234 billion by Moody's Investors Service.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated it is willing to bolster some state and local governments by lending to them through a $500 billion facility but the terms of the program may be too restrictive to do much good, said Mikhail Foux, municipal bond strategist at Barclays PLC.\n\n\"They need to change the language if they want issuers to borrow from them,\" he said.\n\nThe MTA has been negotiating to borrow funds from the federal program through New York state to repay $1.1 billion of debt that falls due over the summer, according to marketing materials for the bond the authority sold this week. Illinois has looked into the lending facility and is awaiting further guidance from the federal government, the budget office spokeswoman said.\n\nIn government-debt markets, U.S. bond yields jumped this morning after the Treasury department announced it would increase the supply of longer-dated debt to pay for spending on response to the coronavirus pandemic. The 10-year yield was around 0.719%, compared with 0.656% Tuesday, according to data from Tradeweb\n\n--Heather Gillers contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com", "uri": "6058095862", "url": "https://www.marketscreener.com//news/With-Federal-Aid-Uncertain-Illinois-and-New-York-s-MTA-Test-Muni-Market--30550651/"}], "6057991816": [391510915, {"sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "published_on": "2020-05-06T14:04:00Z", "name": "Rapid City, S.D., to refinance 2013 sales tax bonds", "dtype": "news", "pk": 391510915, "text": "Even while the nation's economy is reeling from the impact of COVID-19, the municipal bond market is good news for cities looking to restructure their debt because of historically low interest rates.\n\nMonday night, the Rapid City, S.D., Council voted to refinance $15.175 million in sales tax revenue bonds from 2013 to take advantage of the low interest rates.\n\nThe city's Chief Financial Officer Pauline Sumption said the refinancing is expected to save the city $808,291.12 in interest payments through 2033.\n\n\"By refinancing this, the bonds will still pay off in 20 years, so in 2033 they will be paid in full.

SCHZ has followed the fixed-income market higher in 2020, which has been a welcome respite for investors, given how poorly equities have fared. Looking ahead, I see more modest returns, for a few reasons. One, interest rates are at record low levels, in the U.S. and around the world. If the next move in rates is higher, that will cause the value of funds like SCHZ to decline. Two, demand from central banks, notably the Fed, has pushed up asset prices in many sectors. While this has rewarded current investors, it limits the opportunity for new money. Three, income potential is lower currently than it has been, due to declining interest rates and rising bond prices. Corporate bond spreads have also narrowed, and are actually close to reaching their pre-crisis levels. That concerns me, given how optimistic the market was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given how clouded the outlook is now, I believe it will be very challenging to re-test those levels.\n\nFirst, a little about SCHZ. It is an ETF with a primary objective \"to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the total return of the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index.\" Currently, the fund trades at $55.66/share and pays monthly distributions, with yield of 2.65%. I covered SCHZ for the first time about six months ago, when I recommended investors pick up some shares. In hindsight, this was a good call, as the fund has performed quite well since then, and also provided a hedge against equities:\n\nGiven the volatility we have seen in the market in 2020, I figured it was time to take another look at SCHZ, to see if I should change my outlook from here. After review, I believe the fund's upside potential is limited and that a neutral rating is more appropriate, and I will explain why below.\n\nFor this review, I am going to focus on a few of the underlying sectors within SCHZ's portfolio, and why I feel upside is fairly limited in most of them. While the fund is well diversified, the three top sectors make up the bulk of the exposure. In fact, U.S. treasuries, agency MBS, and investment grade corporate bonds make up around 90% of total fund assets, as shown below:\n\nFirst, I want to look at what has been going on in the agency MBS space. For full disclosure, this is an area I have been recommending my readers gain exposure to for some time. Simply, the U.S. housing market had been, until very recently, improving year after year post-recession. In fact, despite the current pandemic, I still believe agency MBS are a smart equity hedge going forward. This is a thesis I have reiterated in multiple reviews recently, and part of the reason is because of direct Fed support within this sector.\n\nWhile I view this support overall as a positive, the point to emphasize now is that I believe the \"easy money\" has probably been made. What I mean by that is the Fed has been buying up assets in this sector since the middle of March. As a result, the prices on the underlying bonds have moved sharply higher in a short amount of time. To illustrate, consider the graph below, which shows the price for domestic (U.S.) agency MBS prices for varying interest rate levels:\n\nAs you can see, when the Fed began buying these securities on March 16, the prices shot up quickly, and have since stayed quite high.\n\nMy takeaway here is this does not mean investors need to flee this sector, or that they should expect a sudden reversal back to pre-Fed buying prices. However, it does mean investor expectations should be tempered. The Fed buying has pushed up prices for new investors now, which will limit total return going forward. Of course, prices can move up more, especially if the Fed continues to buy and retail investor demand remains high. But there is a limit to how high these prices can go, and I believe prices won't see much more meaningful upside, especially over the longer term. While the income stream generated by these securities could certainly be attractive, especially given the relative safety of the asset class, investors should also be concerned with capital appreciation. On that note, I do not expect much going forward.\n\nMy next points touch on both the investment grade corporate bond sector and also U.S. treasuries. Similar to agency MBS, the Fed has been buying up both of these assets on the open market. The result so far has been robustly positive, with bond prices recovering and liquidity returning to the markets. Simultaneously, equities reversed their free-fall and rebounded markedly. All this led to April being one of the best months for investors on record.\n\nHowever, this performance, while positive for current investors, should also make investors cautious on the potential for future returns. With the Fed buying up assets across the fixed-income world, prices have risen and yields have dropped. This makes new positions look less attractive, all other things being equal. In fact, treasury yields now sit at their lowest level in over a year, while corporate bond spreads have narrowed almost to their pre-pandemic low, as shown in the graph below:\n\nMy overall takeaway here is this should force investors to be realistic about how likely it is these sectors will offer meaningful returns from here. While the graph shows corporate bond spreads have room to tighten and still be within their historical range, we have to remember those tight spreads existed before the COVID-19 crisis wreaked havoc on the economy. Consumer and investor confidence were at high levels prior to this crisis, and the world has changed quite a bit since then. Bidding up prices further and sending spreads back to pre-crisis lows, during a climate where government assistance is required around the world just to keep economies afloat, does not seem prudent to me. Simply, I believe investors are due to give this market a reality check, and I expect spreads to widen, rather than tighten, in the near term. And the graph shows there is indeed plenty of room to widen.\n\nExpanding on the above graph, when we look at treasury yields, we see investors are getting a historically small amount of compensation for buying those assets. While I would continue to advocate buying government bonds for the long term, I again would manage expectations. Investors may be able to rely on the income stream, but further underlying price gains will be hard to come by. While demand has been high up to this point, U.S. investors may not be willing to purchase zero, or even negative, yielding bonds that we have seen in other parts of the world. This is a key reason why I believe downgrading my outlook, from bullish to neutral, makes a lot of sense.\n\nMy final point has a bit more optimistic tone, with respect to the total return potential for SCHZ. As I alluded to, I am not bearish on this fund. While I see less potential than I did in Q4 last year, tailwinds for aggregate bond funds do exist, which justifies my neutral outlook over a more pessimistic view.\n\nSpecifically, low interest rates at home and around the world could still drive future investor demand. I did note that I expect interest rates to rise next, rather than fall further, but it may take a while for that to happen. This would leave global investors in a low rate environment for some time, and will serve as a catalyst for U.S. fixed-income sectors. The reason is U.S. interest rates, despite being quite low, are still higher than other countries/regions, which means the yields offered by U.S. government bonds and U.S. corporate bonds are relatively attractive.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the chart below, which shows the countries around the world that have lower or equal benchmark rates to the Fed:\n\nAs you can see, many of the developed global regions have ultra low, sometimes even negative, benchmark rates. The result has been robust foreign demand for U.S. fixed-income assets, and this is a trend that should continue as long as the status quo remains intact.\n\nMy takeaway here is that, ultimately, SCHZ could continue to see plenty of interest, and there is a case to be made that the fund will move higher from here. However, my final observation on this point is the yield, at 2.65%, is only relatively attractive if we consider investments in global government bonds. If we move away from aggregate funds that are less reliant on treasuries or foreign government bonds, investors could find a better yield elsewhere. Two examples, which also focus exclusively on debt rated investment-grade, are listed below:\n\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nTherefore, investors could move away from a broader, diversified approach, and into the sectors with more attractive yields, while also taking on a similar level of credit risk. Investment grade corporate bonds have a strong historical track record, and a yield above 3% catches the eye. Further, investment grade municipal bonds are also backed by a history of low defaults. While the yield of 2.41% appears lower on the surface, when we factor in the fact that this debt is tax-exempt, it also bests the income stream offered by SCHZ right now.\n\nSCHZ has delivered over the past six months, justifying positions in fixed-income products as a way to hedge equity risk. As we look deeper into 2020, there is absolutely a case to be made to remain long on this fund. However, I believe total return is going to be limited. Interest rates have bottomed out, in my view, and corporate yield spreads have tightened. The reversal of both of these trends represents important headwinds for SCHZ. Further, while foreign demand for U.S. fixed-income assets will likely remain high for the remainder of 2020, those investors have multiple options available to them. Other funds, such as those that focus exclusively on investment grade corporate bonds, offer a higher income stream. Finally, the Fed's aggressive asset buying program has rewarded current investors, but this buying will not last forever, especially once the economy recovers. When the Fed demand declines, prices in agency MBS and investment grade corporate bonds will probably fall. Therefore, I believe a shift to a neutral outlook on SCHZ is appropriate, and I would encourage investors to be very selective on any new positions at this time.", "uri": "6057948077", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4343530-schz-upside-will-be-hard-to-come"}], "6057794525": [830989114, {"sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "published_on": "2020-05-06T11:04:00Z", "name": "Looking Back at April Through an ETF Lens", "dtype": "news", "pk": 830989114, "text": "Global financial markets picked themselves off the canvas and came back swinging in April. Here, I will look at how major asset classes performed, where investors were putting their money, and whether there may still be bargains--all through the lens of exchange-traded funds.\n\nDon't Call It a Comeback\n\nMost major asset classes bounced back in April. Of the 2,130 nonleveraged exchange-traded products in Morningstar's U.S. database, just 160 (7.5%) posted losses for the month. Prominent among them were funds investing in municipal bonds and ETPs that invest in oil futures. Municipal bond markets saw continued price pressure in April; the outlook for state and local government budgets continues to deteriorate as tax revenues shrivel. Oil-based ETPs experienced sharp price declines as lousy market fundamentals kept pressure on prices and the front-month futures contract tipped into negative territory for the first time in history.\n\nExhibit 1 features April market price performance figures for a sampling of Morningstar Medalist ETFs representing most major asset classes. Investors in a blended global market portfolio gained just over 7% in April. Stock markets were up across the board, though some fared better than others. U.S. stocks outperformed both developed international and emerging-markets stocks.\n\nWithin the U.S. market, mid-caps outperformed both large and small caps. IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH), which has a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, outpaced Gold-rated iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), chiefly because of its exposure to better-performing names in the consumer discretionary and healthcare sectors. IJH also outstripped Gold-rated iShares Core S&P Small Cap ETF (IJR) in April. In this case, much of its relative performance can be attributed to stock selection within the healthcare and financials sectors. The performance spread across the diagonal of the Morningstar Style Box narrowed in April. For example, iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which falls in the large-growth Morningstar Category, outperformed iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF (IJS), which sits in small-value, by just 36 basis points. In March, IJS lagged IVW by nearly 15.5 percentage points. IJS' greater exposure to economically sensitive names in the financials, consumer discretionary, real estate, and energy sectors contributed to its poor showing in March. In April, many of these same exposures--most notably in energy stocks--gave the small-value fund a lift.\n\nApart from municipal bonds, fixed-income markets recovered in April. Credit markets snapped back following the Federal Reserve's late-March intervention--even though the Fed won't begin purchasing corporate bonds and corporate-bond ETFs until later this month. The mere act of the Fed brandishing its bazooka was enough to bring some semblance of order back to the market.\n\nStrategic-beta ETFs representing a variety of individual factors all lagged the broader stock market in April. Despite the fact they put up positive returns, value-oriented funds continue to struggle on a relative basis. Meanwhile, momentum stocks continue to be resilient. At the end of April, iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) was trading at a 25% discount to its Morningstar fair value estimate, while iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) was priced a bit rich.\n\nBack Into Bonds and Learning About Commodities Futures the Hard Way\n\nETF flows favored bond funds in April. Fixed-income ETFs took in $21 billion in net new flows during the month, a near mirror image of their experience in March (see Exhibit 2). Notable among the asset gatherers in the bond space were Bronze-rated iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) and Neutral-rated iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG). In separate announcements in March and April, the Fed indicated that both funds would be eligible for purchase by the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility--a fact that was not lost on investors, as evidenced by the subsequent surge of inflows. For its part, the Fed has yet to buy a single share of any eligible ETF. It recently announced that it would begin making purchases in early May.\n\nCommodities ETPs also saw significant inflows in April. Physical gold ETFs continued to gain assets from safe-haven seekers. SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) saw $4.9 billion in net new inflows. Oil-futures-based ETPs hit a gusher. Roughly $3.8 billion poured in to United States Oil (USO). The product attracted the interest of investors around the world, ranging from individuals looking to make a bet on rebounding crude prices to traders creating new shares to sell short. The result was a debacle. The product had to undergo a turbo-charged metamorphosis to stay afloat--rejiggering its investment objective on the fly in response to unprecedented volatility in oil-futures markets and swelling assets. This episode underscores the need for better labeling for ETPs and greater investor protections.\n\nLooking at flows at an ETF issuer level can help tune out some of the noisiness that is a regular feature of short-term ETF flows and yield some signals. From this perspective (see Exhibit 5), it appears that the steady-Eddie clientele served by firms like Vanguard, which tend to serve more advisors and individual investors, are steady as ever. Meanwhile, market volatility continued to be a boon for firms like State Street and ProShares, whose ranges cater to a crowd that uses ETFs in a more tactical manner.\n\nAre There Any Bargains Left?\n\nThe Morningstar fair value estimate for ETFs rolls up Morningstar's equity analysts' fair value estimates for individual stocks and our quantitative fair value estimates for those stocks not covered by Morningstar analysts into an aggregate fair value estimate for stock ETFs' portfolios. Dividing this value by ETFs' market prices yields a price/fair value ratio. This ratio can point to potential bargains.\n\nExhibit 6 features the 10 ETFs that were trading at the largest discount to their fair value estimates as of the end of April. Five of them belong to the equity energy category. Pain has been pervasive in the energy sector as demand has declined and supply continues to come to market. With producers running out of places to store their output, prices have collapsed--as have the share prices of firms operating in the oil and gas services industry.\n\nBut the market is a discounting mechanism, and in April investors were betting that this too shall pass. Energy stocks rallied in April. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE), which holds the energy names in the S&P 500, gained nearly 31%. But these stocks have fallen a long way. Even after a double-digit rally, many are still trading at steep discounts.\n\nThe list also features a pair of cannabis ETFs. The share prices of firms involved in the cannabis industry had already been under pressure before the onset of the current crisis, which helps explain why they're featured here in the bargain bin, as well as why they were a bit sluggish in the April rebound.\n\nExhibit 7 features the 10 broad-based ETFs that were trading at the largest discount to their fair value estimates as of the end of April. The common thread among most of these funds is an orientation toward smaller, cheaper stocks. Some of them deliberately lean into value by virtue of selecting and weighting stocks based on value criteria. This is the case for funds like Invesco S&P SmallCap 600 Pure Value ETF (RZV). Others back into a deep-value orientation by selecting stocks based on their dividend yields. WBI Power Factor High Dividend ETF (WBIY) is an example. The fund selects its 50-stock portfolio from the highest-yielding half of its selection universe.", "uri": "6057794525", "url": "https://www.morningstar.com/articles/982738/looking-back-at-april-through-an-etf-lens"}], "6057698206": [176505596, {"sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "published_on": "2020-05-06T09:34:00Z", "name": "Climate Change and Municipal Finance - Center for American Progress", "dtype": "news", "pk": 176505596, "text": "Climate change will negatively affect every aspect of life and economic production. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global temperatures have already risen by 1 degree Celsius compared to preindustrial levels. In the absence of aggressive and sustained reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures will very likely hit and surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius by as early as 2030. Higher global average temperatures will cause more devastating storms, floods, and fires as well as rising sea levels.\n\nFor many years, climate economists have focused on how the effects of climate change will reduce gross domestic product as well as the earnings of firms directly tied to the production and heavy use of fossil fuels, including the oil, power, and chemical sectors. More recently, researchers have turned their attention to systemically important financial institutions and capital markets, which underpin every aspect of the economy.\n\nClimate change has the potential to have a large impact on the normal functioning of the financial system. Financial markets rely on participants' belief that the prices of debt and equity securities and other financial products more or less approximate the underlying real economy and its risks. When a natural disaster, pandemic, or other economic shock reveals a large gap between actual risk and asset prices, markets can experience severe volatility. When investors do not understand what is happening in a particular market, they withdraw their capital and look for safe havens. Stated differently, capital markets rely on steady investor demand to provide liquidity. Investor demand in turn relies on accurate pricing. Accurate pricing relies in turn on effective risk assessment. And effective risk assessment relies in turn on transparency and comprehensive disclosures.\n\nProviding accurate and effective assessments of climate risk is critical for maintaining stable financial systems, but are state and local government municipal bond issuers providing potential investors with accurate and comprehensive climate risk disclosures?\n\nWhile no comprehensive data exist, evidence suggests that climate disclosures in state and local government municipal bonds are a relatively new occurrence, with many issuers including minimal details about how climate could negatively affect an issuer's ability to make bond payments over time. This issue brief uses a recent revenue bond issuance by the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (WASD) to highlight the shortcomings of limited disclosures.\n\nClimate change is an unprecedented global reality that will require reform in every aspect of the economy, including public finance. Federal regulations should require state and local issuers to provide investors with robust climate risk disclosures. Comprehensive disclosure of climate risk will help ensure that the municipal market continues to enjoy accurate risk-based pricing and a high degree of liquidity.\n\nThe municipal bond market is the mechanism by which state, local, and special purpose governmental entities borrow money to finance capital projects and ongoing operations. According to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, roughly two-thirds of all infrastructure projects rely on municipal bond financing. The municipal bond market is large. Currently, there is more than $4.1 trillion in outstanding issuances. Without access to capital markets, state and local governments would not be able to provide basic services or build the infrastructure that facilitates economic growth over time. Therefore, it is essential that the municipal market continue to function well.\n\nThese securities also provide an important option for investors. Nearly two-thirds of all municipal securities are held by individuals either directly or through mutual funds. Municipal securities are attractive to investors for two reasons. First, investors are not required to pay federal or state income taxes on the interest income provided by the bonds. Second, municipal bonds have a very low default rate. According to data from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, muni bonds have a default rate of just 0.18 percent, compared with 1.74 percent for equivalently rated corporate debt securities.\n\nTo function well, the muni market requires accurate risk-based pricing to ensure steady investor demand -- i.e., no shortage of liquidity -- and low volatility. In the absence of comprehensive and accurate climate disclosures, state and local governments may have trouble finding buyers for future issuances or be forced to pay substantially higher interest rates to attract the same level of investor demand. Additionally, if investors do not feel that they can effectively differentiate issuances that face a high degree of climate risk from those with a lower risk profile, they may demand a risk premium across the entire asset class. A uniform risk premium would penalize issuers with lower-risk securities.\n\nUnfortunately, many state and local issuers either do not include any climate risk disclosures or provide only a cursory reference to climate change without meaningful detail. Moreover, there is no affirmative federal regulatory requirement that issuers include a specific climate disclosure.\n\nEvery loan involves the risk of nonrepayment. Specifically, creditors -- the individuals and institutions that purchase municipal bonds -- take on the risk that the state or local government debtor will fail to collect sufficient tax or fee revenue to make bond payments. Many factors can negatively affect tax and fee collections, including acute events such as natural disasters and epidemics, as well as broader structural pressures such as a recession or sea level rise.\n\nThere are two broad categories of municipal bond: general obligation and revenue. General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing jurisdiction. This simply means that the state or local government pledges to use its power of taxation to collect enough revenue to make bond payments. For instance, a recent general obligation bond issued by Miami-Dade County for ongoing health facilities and services states, \"The full faith, credit and taxing power of the County are irrevocably pledged to the prompt payment of both principal of and interest on the Bonds.\"\n\nRevenue bonds are backed by a specific source of tax or user fee revenue. For instance, the offering documents for the most recent Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department bonds states, \"The payment of principal of and interest on the Series 2019 Bonds is secured by a pledge of and lien on the Net Operating Revenues of the Utility (the \"Pledged Revenues\").\" According to the offering documents, operating revenues are defined as \"user charges for the provision of water service and sewer service, meter installation fees, and the like, delinquent charges and investment earnings.\" If the department's user fee revenues are insufficient to make bond payments, investors would have no recourse to any other tax or user fee revenues collected by Miami-Dade County.\n\nInvestors typically consider general obligation bonds lower risk than revenue bonds. The perception of risk comes down to taxing authority. WASD only has the power to raise user fees on the drinking water and wastewater services it provides customers, whereas Miami-Dade County has broad powers of taxation, including over real property and sales transactions, among others.\n\nAnother way to think about the issue is that each type of revenue pledge is more or less vulnerable to different types of external shock. For example, Miami-Dade County collects a 6 percent hotel occupancy tax, but discretionary consumer expenditures such as vacations involving a hotel stay are highly sensitive to economic conditions. Even a modest downturn can hit hotel tax collections hard. Other revenue pledges -- such as tolls on a highway bridge -- tend to be more durable because commuting and daily mobility needs do not change as rapidly. Conversely, a severe storm that causes the shuttering of a toll bridge for structural repairs may result in investor losses, whereas the surrounding county may recover more quickly with comparatively less disruption to sales or property tax collections.\n\nThe unique characteristics of each municipal bond issuance -- including the source of taxes or fees to service the debt for revenue pledges -- should drive the specific content of climate risk disclosures.\n\nSouth Florida faces significant climate change risks, including from acute shocks such as hurricanes as well as long-term structural pressures including rising sea levels. These stresses combined with the unique geology of the region will increase the cost of providing drinking water and wastewater services. Moreover, the complex politics of climate change mean that investors should not assume that Washington will always provide robust disaster aid. Taken together, these factors increase the risk of investor losses and should be disclosed in muni bond offering documents.\n\nWASD is an enterprise unit of Miami-Dade County. The department functions as a separate business unit within Miami-Dade County. WASD's business is proving commercial and residential customers with drinking water and wastewater services. This means that its finances are functionally separate from the county at large.\n\nIn October 2019, WASD issued $233 million in revenue bonds to finance a portion of its long-term capital improvements program. (The brief refers to these as 2019 bonds). The capital program makes upgrades to both drinking water and wastewater projects and includes a mixture of standard maintenance and replacement of aging facilities, improvements to comply with health and environmental regulations, and upgrades to reduce energy consumption and better withstand the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe revenue source pledged to repay investors is the user fees the department charges commercial and residential customers for drinking water and wastewater services. Importantly, this same revenue source is also pledged to eight previous municipal bond issuances made by WASD since 2008, which have a total outstanding value of $2.1 billion. The 2019 bonds are \"on parity as to source and security for payment with the Outstanding Bonds.\" The investors who purchased the 2019 bonds have an equal claim to the user fee revenues as all the other investors in the previously issued debt.\n\nThe 2019 bonds received an investment grade rating with a stable outlook from three national rating organizations. S&P rated the bonds AA-, Moody's rated them Aa3, and Fitch gave the bonds A+. Part of the reason for this rating is that the 2019 bonds come with a rate covenant and a reserve account. A rate covenant is a promise to investors that the department will continue to charge user fee rates for drinking water and wastewater services that are equal to \"one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the Principal and Interest Requirements on the Bonds.\" Moreover, WASD promised to charge rates that cover \"one hundred percent (100%) of the required deposits into the Reserve Account.\"\n\nThe reserve account must be capitalized with enough money to make all principal and interest payments for one full fiscal year on all the bonds that share the save user fee revenue pledge. According to the offering documents, the reserve account will include cash and insurance policies equal to $189.7 million. It's important to note that WASD's user fee revenues must cover ongoing operating expenses in addition to servicing debt obligations.\n\nBased on historical data, the rate covenant and reserve account should provide a financial cushion capable of protecting investors against an unexpected downturn in WASD revenues over the life of the bonds. Yet climate change represents a decisive break from historical patterns, placing a large question mark over the adequacy of WASD's reserve account specifically and rating agency standards generally.\n\nThe recent history of the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA) demonstrates how catastrophic storms can lead to unprecedented asset destruction and revenue losses. In early September 2017, Hurricane Irma -- one of the most powerful storms every recorded in the Atlantic -- passed by Puerto Rico, unleashing torrential rains and harsh winds. The storm killed three people and left nearly 70 percent of the island without power. Not even two weeks later, Hurricane Maria hit the island, knocking out the rest of the power grid and causing even more devastation.\n\nThe two storms caused catastrophic damage to PRASA's infrastructure and caused a severe drop in revenues. The financial tumult continues. In fact, PRASA's most recent audited financial statement ends on June 30, 2017, prior to the hurricanes. Ongoing disclosures tied to PRASA muni bonds provide a window into the volatility of the authority's financial situation.\n\nIn April 2018, as part of a potential restructuring of its outstanding debt, the authority released some financial estimates. According to PRASA, the storms resulted in the suspension of meter readings for 60 days from September 16, 2017, to November 16, 2017. During this time, PRASA lost $271 million in water revenues. The authority states, \"For FY2018, revenues are expected to be substantially lower than budgeted due to, among other things, population migration, decline in economic activity and lower consumption for the period when clients did not have service and lower collections rate.\" To compound matters, PRASA notes that many water clients are eligible for \"a deficient service credit.\"\n\nPRASA also estimates incremental costs associated with storm response of $396 million and capital repairs of $769 million, for a total cost of $1.4 billion. Importantly, this estimate excludes additional capital projects that would improve system resilience to future storms. When resilience improvements are added to the plan, the total cost jumps to $4.8 billion. To put this number in perspective, it is equivalent to all outstanding bonds and notes payable that PRASA reported in its financial statement issued prior to the two hurricanes.\n\nPRASA's recent experience is a powerful reminder that water authorities face the threat of lost revenues from both demand- and supply-side disruptions. When a storm or other disaster damages water assets and interrupts service, a water authority cannot deliver potable water or treat wastewater. The disruption of drinking water and wastewater supply leads to reduced billings. Water authorities also carry revenue risk from a reduction in demand. For instance, if a storm leaves water infrastructure in tact but causes severe damage to homes and businesses, the authority can experience lost revenue. This threat is not limited to island communities such as Puerto Rico.\n\nAccording to data from the Insurance Information Institute, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 left approximately 250,000 people homeless in Miami-Dade County. Moreover, roughly 25,500 homes were destroyed and another 100,000 were damaged. Climate change increases the likelihood that Miami-Dade and WASD will experience another storm like hurricanes Andrew, Irma, or Maria.\n\nBeyond acute shocks such as hurricanes, WASD faces significant long-term costs tied to climate adaptation. As part of its 20-year planning process for drinking water services, WASD notes, \"Climate change and sea level rise are expected to present significant challenges relating to water resource planning.\" The largest risk is from \"salt water intrusion into the freshwater Biscayne aquifer,\" which provides drinking water for the region.\n\nThe freshwater Biscayne aquifer is primarily made up of \"highly porous and transmissive\" limestone, which is exposed to saltwater intrusion at the coastal margins. The zone where the freshwater and saltwater meet is referred to as the \"salt front\" or the \"freshwater saltwater interface.\"\n\nShifting demographics, rising seas, and seasonal changes all affect saltwater intrusion. Under normal conditions, freshwater percolates into the aquifer and saturates the porous limestone, creating outward pressure that keeps saltwater from seeping in. But as the population of South Florida grows, it increases demand for freshwater, which WASD meets by pumping water out of the aquifer. This creates an opening for saltwater to intrude. The problem is especially acute during the dry season, when there is less recharge of the aquifer.\n\nAdditionally, WASD and the U.S. Geological Survey estimate sea level rise of between 9 inches and 24 inches by 2060. When the county modeled the effects of seal level rise, it found that, \"Increased sea level resulted in landward migration of the freshwater-seawater interface.\" This results in an increased concentration of chloride in the aquifer, which WASD must treat or otherwise resort to finding an alternative freshwater source -- both of which come with a large price tag.\n\nThe hydrological challenges for the region don't stop with saltwater intrusion. The county found that rising groundwater levels increase the risk of flooding during major rain storms: \"rising groundwater ... reduce[s] soil storage and discharge capacity, with increased potential for both inland and coastal flooding.\" South Florida also has an extensive network of canals that help with storm drainage. As sea levels rise, \"the canals are not able to drain as quickly and ... there is less capacity for managing the hydrologic system.\" In the future, WASD will likely have to shoulder additional capital costs to combat the risk of flooding, adding to its debt burden and potentially increasing the risk of default.\n\nManaging these challenges and adapting to climate change will add to WASD's operating and capital costs. Yet the 2019 bond documents make no mention of saltwater intrusion and only mention sea level rise twice without connecting the threat to authority revenues.\n\nAnother investor risk factor that issuers overlook is political risk. State and local issuers benefit from the fact that the federal government has historically acted as a financial backstop. When catastrophic storms hit local communities, the federal government typically steps in with financial aid to rebuild broken infrastructure and catalyze the return of normal economic activity. This de facto federal guarantee reduces the risk of investor losses.\n\nThis guarantee may not last for two reasons. First, the rise of political polarization means that disaster aid presents an attractive lever to extract votes or damage political opponents. Second, as climate change brings about more frequent and severe storms, public support for costly bailouts may weaken. Puerto Rico serves as a powerful example of political risk.\n\nIn its April 2018 bond disclosure documents, PRASA anticipated that a substantial portion of the $396 million in incremental costs and $769 million in repair costs will be covered by insurance policies and federal disaster assistance grants. However, according to The Washington Post, the Trump administration has continued to withhold disaster aid: \"The U.S. territory is still waiting on billions of dollars approved by Congress for recovery from Hurricane Maria more than two years ago, though the administration recently agreed to release some of the money subject to several conditions.\" Given the important role of emergency aid following acute shocks such as hurricanes and other natural disasters, bond-offering documents should similarly include a disclosure about the political risks of assuming that Washington will always provide sufficient disaster relief.\n\nTo date, capital markets have not systematically priced climate risk into municipal bonds. This is expected to change relatively soon. An analysis by BlackRock Investment Institute found that state and local governments that have collectively issued 15 percent of outstanding muni bonds -- roughly $615 billion -- will face climate impacts that could meaningfully reduce economic output. For instance, BlackRock estimates that annual hurricane damage could cost South Florida an equivalent of 2.5 percent of local gross domestic product. Data from the Federal Reserve show that 2.5 percent of Miami-Dade County's current economic output is equivalent to $4.1 billion.\n\nThis may not seem like much but consider that the reduced economic activity predicted by BlackRock will take place within a context of rising costs. Population growth in South Florida will require WASD to expand its facilities, and inflation will drive up the cost of materials and labor. Additionally, more stringent public health and environmental regulations will increase both capital and operations costs even as WASD will need to expand its capital program to include ever larger and more expensive climate adaptation projects. Meanwhile, capital markets may begin demanding a climate risk premium on newly issued bonds. Rising costs and reduced economic activity have the potential to become a negative feedback loop, placing serious fiscal strain on WASD.\n\nBy providing investors with robust and -- to the greatest extent possible -- quantitative climate disclosures, WASD will help capital markets price their future debt appropriately. In the absence of a meaningful disclosure, WASD runs the risk that the market will lump its securities in with all coastal water authorities regardless of the underlying climate risk fundamentals. If WASD and Miami-Dade County have taken aggressive adaptation measures that meaningfully reduce climate risks, they should be rewarded by the market with access to cheaper debt. In the absence of issuer risk differentiation, WASD would be forced to pay an unnecessary premium -- the market's version of socializing expected losses.\n\nMunicipal bond issuances are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In general, issuers are required to disclose information to potential investors that allows for \"an informed investment decision.\" Each muni bond will provide investors with different information depending on the issuer and the nature of the bond. For instance, a general obligation bond issued by a state to finance ongoing operations and backed by income or other general tax collections will contain substantially different information than a private activity bond for an infrastructure project that uses a public-private partnership procurement model that is backed exclusively by user fee revenues.\n\nRegardless of these differences, all muni issuers must avoid making material misstatements or omissions in their offering documents to prospective investors. According to the SEC, a misstatement or an omission is considered material if \"the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item.\" Misspelling the name of the financial advising firm that provided consulting services to the issuer would not be material. By comparison, omitting major outstanding governmental debts or overstating tax revenues would be material.\n\nGoing forward, failing to disclose detailed climate change risks should be considered a material omission. Both acute events such as wildfires, floods, and hurricanes as well as structural changes such as rising sea levels will negatively affect governmental revenues and increase the likelihood of investor losses. Moreover, mitigating and adapting to climate pressures will add substantial capital and operational costs to the continued provision of essential governmental services.\n\nWASD's 2019 bonds include a limited climate disclosure that provides a simple qualitative recognition that climate change may produce \"negative economic impacts.\" The disclosure also mentions in general terms the department's efforts at sustainability and implementation of climate-related \"policies and initiatives,\" with a link to Miami-Dade County's climate change strategy known as GreenPrint -- a neologism intended to convey the sustainability of the region's footprint -- and a link to the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact.\n\nThe official statement for the 2019 bonds includes the following climate disclosure language:\n\nThe State of Florida is naturally susceptible to the effects of extreme weather events and natural disasters including floods, droughts, and hurricanes, which could result in negative economic impacts on coastal communities like the County. Such effects can be exacerbated by a longer-term shift in the climate over several decades (commonly referred to as climate change), including increasing global temperatures and rising sea levels.\n\nThe County is addressing the threat of climate change in the following ways: (1) implementing new policies and initiatives, including environmental protections, sustainability measures, and energy and water conservation; and (2) completing a systematic assessment of the future vulnerability of the most critical County-owned infrastructure and using that information to direct investment into protective measures for the County's most exposed assets. The County's climate change strategy is outlined in the GreenPrint link on the County's website ... and in the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact's (the \"Compact\") Regional Climate Action Plan ... For planning purposes the County relies upon the Compact's Unified Sea Level Rise Projection for Southeast Florida.\n\nThe GreenPrint strategy is an admirable undertaking -- especially considering the hostility toward climate science emanating from Tallahassee -- that lays out ideas and goals for producing a new generation of climate leaders, creating green jobs as part of a vibrant economy, educating the public about climate change, supporting sustainable land use, and reducing energy and water use, among other areas.\n\nThe last goal is particularly relevant to WASD since water utilities are major energy consumers, which makes drinking water and wastewater services a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the department is Florida Power & Light's largest customer in South Florida. As part of its long-term capital program, WASD is making investments to improve energy efficiency. These improvements will both lower the department's operating costs and help the county meet its emissions goals.\n\nUnfortunately, this deeply laudable and necessary effort at environmental stewardship does not obviate the need to provide potential investors with robust climate risk information. WASD's minimalist disclosure and reference to the GreenPrint plan do not address the fundamental question of how climate change risks could lead to investor losses over time.\n\nSimilarly, the disclosure links to the plans and goals established by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. The compact lays out goals across a number of areas, including agriculture, energy and water use, natural systems, and social equity, among others. The section on water includes 21 goals. These range from very high-level, aspirational goals such as \"Foster innovation, development, and exchange of ideas for managing water\" to somewhat more specific goals such as \"Advance capital projects to achieve resilience in water infrastructure.\" As with the GreenPrint goals, this information is not specific enough to the assets and revenues of WASD to meaningfully inform the decisions of potential investors.\n\nBoth the GreenPrint and compact plans demonstrate that the threat of climate change has penetrated the consciousness of regional elected officials, planners, and civic leaders. This is immensely important since climate change is the greatest collective action problem the world has ever encountered. These plans provide a meaningful indication that regional leaders are pulling in roughly the same sustainability direction. However, these plans do not make up for the inadequacy of the climate disclosure included within the 2019 bond-offering documents.\n\nAn effective and comprehensive disclosure should provide a clear explanation and quantitative estimates of how both acute shocks and long-term climate changes could reduce issuer revenues or lead to higher operating and capital costs. Above all, a climate disclosure must be forward-looking. Typically, bond documents provide historical information. The 2019 bonds include, as an appendix, WASD's most recent certified financial statement. The statement allows a potential investor to understand the basics of WASD's revenue model, annual expenses, outstanding debt, and other core financial statistics. Yet historical financial performance does not provide much value for assessing future risk since climate change represents a fundamental break with the past.\n\nA better approach would be for the state or local issuer to present multiple risk-based revenue scenarios. Climate models typically output a range of estimates for things such as sea level rise, drought cycles, and storm severity. A scenario analysis would look at how a range of potential shocks could reduce revenues. The analysis could answer a question such as: How long of a disruption in billing would be required to exhaust the bond reserve account? As part of the analysis, WASD could provide data on revenue losses stemming from Hurricane Andrew and crosswalk that with predictive storm models.\n\nIn addition, a scenario analysis could determine how much additional borrowing backed by the same revenue pledge would be needed if 10, 20, or 30 percent of authority assets needed replacement following a major storm. With respect to long-term costs tied to climate adaptation, a scenario analysis could look at the costs associated with different saltwater intrusion assumptions. This could answer questions including: At what point would saltwater intrusion require WASD to develop alternative freshwater sources? What would the estimated capital outlay be for either sourcing freshwater from other parts of the state or engaging in large-scale desalinization?\n\nThese are only a few of the questions and analyses that would provide potential investors with material information about climate-related risks. Each muni bond issuance is unique. This means that each issuance will need a slightly different set of quantitative scenario analyses. The point is that the current approach of including a simple qualitative statement recognizing climate change as an extant fact is insufficient. Investors already know this. What matters is how climate change will affect the ability of the issuer to service the debt security in question.\n\nIt is common for issuers to provide technical reports prepared by outside experts as part of muni bond offering documents. Moving to a disclosure regime that includes climate risk will require most issuers to engage with outside technical experts. State and local issuers should not bear the full cost of creating a new set of disclosure standards, since a well-functioning muni market provides significant benefits to the economy and society at large. For this reason, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the SEC, working with other relevant agencies and regulators, should establish a clearing house for climate data and establish best analytical practices. Additionally, these agencies should provide direct technical assistance during the early years of implementing any new climate disclosure requirements.\n\nOf course, federal financial support to state and local governments should not be limited to technical assistance for bond disclosures. Every state and local community faces complex trade-offs and costly projects to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Yet economic disparities that stem from persistent discrimination based on race and ethnicity mean that disadvantaged communities will have fewer resources to combat the climate crisis. Federal climate policy must recognize the legacy of discrimination and provide robust funding to those communities facing the greatest need. Otherwise, climate disclosures may result in a risk premium that raises the cost of financing for those communities that can least afford it.\n\nTo ensure the continued stability and liquidity of the muni bond market, federal regulations should require issuers to include comprehensive and, to the greatest extent possible, quantitative scenario-based climate risk disclosures. A robust disclosure requirement, applying to both the initial offering documents and ongoing disclosures as additional material information becomes available, will provide the transparency necessary for risk-based pricing. Climate risk transparency will allow investors to judge each issuance on its merits and avoid the uniform application of a risk premium in bond pricing. In short, a robust disclosure requirement will reward those state and local issuers that have taken the most aggressive mitigation and adaptation efforts with lower financing costs.", "uri": "6057698206", "url": "https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/05/06/484173/climate-change-municipal-finance/"}], "6057497584": [965944566, {"sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "published_on": "2020-05-06T06:10:00Z", "name": "\"Whatever It Takes\" Or \"Whatever Germany Allows\" - Business Quick Magazine", "dtype": "news", "pk": 965944566, "text": "31 January 2020, Berlin: Former ECB President Mario Draghi talks to Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) ... [+] at the award ceremony for the Federal Cross of Merit. Draghi received the Federal Cross of Merit from Federal President Steinmeier. Photo: Britta Pedersen/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa (Photo by Britta Pedersen/picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nThis is part of a series of posts dealing with the impact and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the Financial world.\n\n\"Whatever-It-Takes\" - now there's a marvelously ordinary phrase, but also, as everyone knows, a magical one, once, and maybe now again magical, as we hear it suddenly everywhere, a reassurance, a solemn pledge, a mantra, in the mouths of finance ministers, central bankers, and heads of state, across Europe and beyond. Yes, even heads of state - in the past two months the phrase has been invoked by the elected leaders of the British, Spanish, Italian governments - all quoting it in the original English, by the way, so as to be perfectly clear. The French and German leaders offered their versions in their local dialects, and were also perfectly clear. The American president has used it. The G7 leaders came together and declared their support for WIT. And so the G20: \"We commit to do whatever it takes.\" These are desperate times. This simple phrase changed the course of world history before. Perhaps it will work again. Everyone it seems is trying to conjure its once-upon-a-time power, to push back against the crisis of the moment\n\nThe history of the phrase is almost well-known enough to defy any need for further elaboration. Draghi said it, in 2012, and yes, it was passing comment - some have alleged even an improvised comment - tossed off to a roomful of finance men at a lunch in London. But it worked. Saved the day. His name is linked to it forever. It will certainly be in the first paragraph of his obituaries. \"Whatever It Takes\" will be on Mario Draghi's tombstone.\n\nThe background is this. In 2012, the former President of the European Central Bank was facing a supremely difficult moment in the history of European Project. The Eurozone Crisis was forbiddingly complex, a mess of sovereign default possibilities involving the debt of half a dozen European countries, knock-on threats to major European banks that happened to be holding that debt, and at the pinnacle of the house of cards, the heretofore-untested Euro, a currency without a country, or with too many countries, and no clear sponsor. Then, into this chaos, the President of the European Central Bank (Draghi) stepped forward and arrogated powers that had truly never been actually delegated to him or to the institution, but in the hour of crisis his critics were unwilling/unable to block what seemed to be the only way out of the matter - and the ECB came suddenly and forcefully into its own as a real Central Bank for the EU, with powers perhaps not quite those of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, but close enough. Yes, he usurped, but for the good. Whatever-It-Takes was his declaration of the coup.\n\nHere's what he said:\n\nThe ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\n\nYou can watch the video and what will probably strike you is how little drama these words convey in the live moment. It's just a bureaucrat talking the way bureaucrats talk, or so it may well strike you. But -- in the nature of these things, the traders who move the markets seized on those three words, and walked the Euro back from the brink. The whole situation turned, and the recovery began, right then and there.\n\nWhat does WIT actually signify? One pundit has put it this way, elegantly:\n\nThe words have come to stand for the technocratic determination to meet a crisis with all necessary force.\n\nBut this is too vague. Specifically, Whatever-It-Takes in its original moment signified that the ECB was ready to start printing money, big-time, and to use that flood of money to buy the shaky bonds in question, prop up their prices and so \"save Europe.\" In our era, the process is known by its euphemism - quantitative easing (QE).\n\nQE is a conceptually simple: the central bank goes into the market, like any other trader, and buys bonds, in huge quantities. To pay for these bonds, the central bank prints money, electronically. So if the ECB buys \u20ac100Bn of bonds, it creates \u20ac100Bn of new money, which flows into the market, into the hands of the sellers of those bonds, giving them new scope to spend, lend, and invest. Simple enough. Monetary stimulus.\n\nThe technique was invented by the Japanese in the early years of this century, a desperate ploy, as it was first seen by most Western observers - until the 2008 financial crisis, when QE suddenly became Policy, in the US and then elsewhere, and the Westerners quickly outdid the Japanese.\n\nA QE policy raises tricky questions, though. First - What kind of bonds should the central bank buy? In the beginning, when the bankers were still innocent, they bought only risk-free government bonds, but today (2020) they have become far more liberal, buying mortgage bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, junk bonds, ETFs, equities...\n\nSecond - who do they buy them from? Buying securities in the open market, from any and every willing counterparty, can be seen as relatively impartial. It has the principal effect of providing liquidity to the market. Decisions as to how the newly created money is re-deployed remain with the private sector. But the central banks later began to buy the bonds directly from the issuers of those bonds, starting with their own governments, and by now extending to corporate issuers - which puts the banks in the position of funding those entities, governments and companies, above and beyond and quite aside from improving market liquidity. Which means the banks are increasingly in a position to decide who to fund, sidestepping the capital allocation functions of the market. A can of worms for sure.\n\nThis was what Draghi meant by Whatever-It-Takes, as it turned out: a massive and coordinated program of QE, to compensate for the fact that there is no federal fiscal policy in the EU. Many observers have lately taken to citing the ECB as the savior of the EU, for this reason. It supplies a form of fiscal policy through its targeted bond buying and related programs.\n\nDraghi didn't waltz into this. He had to fight the headwinds of a conservative resistance centered in Germany and the Bundesbank. It was never easy or settled. As recently as last Fall, a cabal of former central bankers from central Europe (mainly Germany and Austria) felt compelled to issue a joint memorandum excoriating Draghi's policies and aiming perhaps to bully his successor (Christine Lagarde) into a reversal of them. She wavered. But with the exigency of the COVID crisis, she fell in line behind Whatever-It-Takes. And all was well. Draghi was wise, and bold, fighting the good fight for Progress and Europe. Lagarde followed the script. The ECB was the best (if not the only) hope for pan-EU governance. How could it be otherwise?\n\nHere's how.\n\nYesterday, the German Constitutional Court (the Bundesverfassungsgericht, if you like) - Germany's closest equivalent to the U.S. Supreme Court - essentially struck down the ECB's entire quantitative easing program.\n\nThe ruling is harsh and unequivocal, even shocking.\n\nFirst of all, the Court declared QE \"illegal\" in principle, illegal for the very reason that WIT has worked - because it strays into \"economic and fiscal policy.\"\n\nSecond, it asserted the priority of German Law over EU Law - the German court bluntly overruled a prior decision in favor of the QE program by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. This left observers gasping (as reported in the Financial Times):\n\n\"This is the first case where a German court says the judgement of the European court has no jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"The Karlsruhe court raised serious questions about the even application of EU law across the bloc.\"\n\nAnd, to leave no doubt that this is no mere judicial opinion, but a legal ruling meant to be enforced, the court instructs the German Parliament to \"take active steps against [QE] in its current form.\" It calls on the Bundesbank to prepare to halt participation in the QE program. Without Germany, the program would be crippled.\n\n\"In theory, only the Bundesbank is bound by these requirements, not the ECB. In practice, however, it is hard to believe that the bond purchases will take place in the future without the participation of the Bundesbank.\"\n\nThe market reacted as one would expect. All the southern European bond prices fell. The German/Italian bond spread widened. The Euro fell against the dollar.\n\nThe European coronavirus response is at risk. Although the court's ruling fig-leafed the COVID matter by temporarily exempting the current aid programs, the message is clear.\n\n\"This limits the scope for buying Italian government bonds in particular.\"\n\n\"This is another barrier to solidarity during the Covid crisis.\"\n\nWhat spectacular bad timing. What worse judgment.\n\nIf Draghi's QE policy was a coup, this is the countercoup, or as one (German) expert put it - \"a declaration of war.\" The ECB's Governing Council announced (icily) that it \"takes note\" of the Court's ruling, but that it \"remains fully committed to doing everything necessary.\" Whatever-It-Takes is still in place. But the German Court's clock is ticking.\n\nWe are approaching the climax of this constitutional drama. In American parlance, this is now a House Divided. And on fire (COVID). The matter must soon break one way or another. There will be common action, solidarity, and, yes, mutualization, sharing of financial obligations - or the end of the ECB's and the EU's only effective collective policy response to the worst economic crisis since World War II.", "uri": "6057497584", "url": "https://bq-magazine.com/whatever-it-takes-or-whatever-germany-allows/"}], "6057243557": [111126594, {"sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "published_on": "2020-05-05T23:55:00Z", "name": "Southside Bancshares Inc (SBSI) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool", "dtype": "news", "pk": 111126594, "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Southside Bancshares, Inc. First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lindsey Bailes, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, madam.\n\nMs. Lindsey Bailes -- Investor Relations Contact\n\nThank you, Hadi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southside Bancshares' First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. A transcript of today's call will be posted on southside.com under Investor Relations. During today's call and other disclosures and presentations, I will remind you that any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described in our earnings release and our Form 10-K. Joining me today are Lee Gibson, President and CEO; and Julie Shamburger, CFO. First, Lee will share his comments around the COVID-19 pandemic and an update on our securities portfolio. Then Julie will give an overview of our financial results.\n\nThank you, Lindsey. I'd like to welcome everyone, and thank you for listening to our First Quarter 2020 Call. Like everyone else on this call, when COVID-19 became a reality in the United States, we quickly changed our daily routines, commerce, methods of conducting business and the economic forecast. We feel very fortunate that we entered this crisis from a position of strength with strong asset quality, capital, liquidity and a low level of nonperforming assets. In addition, Southside has a deep experienced management team adept at navigating challenges. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2020, we reported net income of $4 million and earnings per share of $0.12 after recording a $25.2 million provision for credit losses. During the quarter, we adopted the accounting standard, often referred to as CECL, which resulted in an increase in Southside's allowance for loan losses to $53.6 million from $24.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2019. We believe this significantly higher allowance further enhances our position to successfully navigate through potential unexpected outcomes.\n\nOne of the assumptions that heavily impacts CECL results for a given quarter is the economic forecast. We utilize the Moody's economic forecast with their recommended scenario allocations, all of which, at quarter end, anticipated a significant economic downturn resulting from the pandemic. Our provision for credit losses recorded this quarter was largely a result of these negative economic forecasts. On a quarterly basis linked-quarter basis, nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets decreased to 0.24%, and our tax equivalent net interest margin improved five basis points. During the first quarter, we had solid loan growth of $32.8 million. However, given the negative economic forecast and uncertainty surrounding when the economy may begin to recover, other than short-term PPP loan growth, we do not anticipate meaningful loan growth for the remainder of the year.\n\nDue to the significant declines in short- and long-term interest rates, we entered into an additional $400 million of swaps to lock in longer-term interest rates on funding. At March 31, 2020, these interest rate swap contracts had an average interest rate of 32 basis points with an average weighted maturity of 5.2 years. During March, as volatility in equity markets persisted, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and highly rated municipal bonds also began to experience volatility, primarily due to illiquidity. When this occurred, given our reduced expectations for loan growth, we increased our securities portfolio of approximately $450 million by purchasing $490 million of largely AAA-rated municipal bonds, of which $8 million were taxable. Due to the timing of these transactions, the full impact on interest income and interest expense will be reflected in future quarters. During the first quarter, Southside also repurchased 869,723 shares of its common stock at an average weighted price of $29.71. I want to thank all of the Southside team members for their outstanding attitudes and continued dedication to Southside during this challenging time.\n\nThey eagerly adapted to changes in operational methods and delivery channels while continuing to deliver the high level of quality service our customers expect and deserve. When the Paycheck Protection Program was announced, our lending and credit teams, together with assistance from team members from several additional departments in the bank, began processing over 2,000 PPP loans, providing over $300 million in much needed funding to small businesses. Over the last 60 years, we've seen growth not only in the balance sheet and capital position, but also in the relationships we formed in the communities we serve. We still believe the underpinnings of the Texas markets we serve are sound and will recover once this economic downturn caused by COVID-19 subsides. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to navigate these difficult times and emerge ready to help our customers achieve their financial goals.\n\nThank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call this morning. Despite the adoption of CECL and the COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions beginning in March, we reported net income of $4 million for the first quarter, which includes the $25.2 million in provision for credit losses, primarily in response to the economic uncertainties surrounding COVID-19. We reported diluted earnings per share of $0.12 per share as of March 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.39 per share or 76.5% on a linked-quarter basis. We implemented CECL during the first quarter, resulting in a day one cumulative effect adjustment that decreased retained earnings by $7.8 million net of tax. The adjustment was the result of a $5.3 million increase in the allowance for loan losses from $24.8 million at December 31, 2019, to $30.1 million upon adoption, including $231,000 for purchased loans with credit deterioration. And a $4.8 million increase to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures reported in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nWith the implementation of CECL and expected impacts resulting from COVID-19, the allowance for loan losses increased by $28.8 million to 1.49% of total loans as of first quarter compared to 0.69% of total loans at December 31, 2019. Our nonperforming assets were $17.4 million, essentially flat linked quarter with just a $46,000 decrease. However, due to the increase in our balance sheet, our nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to 0.24% compared to 0.26% at year-end. As mentioned in our earnings release earlier today, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses through the Payroll Protection Program, or PPP, in April under the provisions of the CARES Act. These PPP loans may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll, group healthcare benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments. The remaining loan balance after forgiveness is fully guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA will pay participating lenders, a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan.\n\nWe are pleased to report, as of April 30, we had submitted and received approval on approximately 2,000 loans for a total of just over $300 million. We expect to recognize approximately $10 million in PPP loan-related fees as a yield adjustment over the terms of these loans. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and increased unemployment levels. The resulting temporary closure of many businesses and the implementation of social distancing and sheltering-in-place policies may impact many of our customers. In addition to participation in the Paycheck Protection Program, we are also assisting our borrowers that may be experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19-related challenges with payment deferrals. Generally, these deferrals are for up to three months. As of April 30, 2020, we have granted deferrals totaling approximately $176.7 million of outstanding balances. The largest categories include commercial real estate of $112.7 million and one to four family residential] loans of $47.2 million and together, make up approximately 90% of the total.\n\nAdditionally, of these deferrals, approximately 29% consists of private households, primarily the one to four family residential, 22% in hotels, 17% retail commercial real estate and 5% restaurants. At March 31, 2020, our loans with oil and gas industry exposure were approximately $103 million or 2.86% of our total loan portfolio and deferrals granted from this category approximate 0.43% of all deferrals granted. We begun the year with loan growth, reporting a $32.8 million or 0.9% increase on a linked-quarter basis to $3.6 billion. The increase was driven by growth in our commercial real estate portfolio of $100.6 million and partially offset with decreases primarily in construction loans and commercial loans of $41 million and $17.5 million, respectively. Certainly, as a result of our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program, we will see a significant increase in loans during the second quarter. However, we expect that most of this increase will have paid off by the end of the third quarter. Due to the uncertainty of the full economic impact of COVID-19, we do not believe additional loan growth is likely for 2020. As Lee mentioned in his remarks, our securities portfolio increased by $454.1 million or 18.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.\n\nWe recognized approximately $5.5 million in net securities gains on the sales of AFS securities during the first quarter. At March 31, 2020, we had a net unrealized gain in the securities portfolio of $114 million and a duration of 5.9 years, an increase from 4.4 years at the end of 2019. Our mix of loans and securities shifted to 55% loans and 45% securities compared to a mix of 59% loans and 41% securities at year-end. The shift was driven by our strategic purchases in the securities portfolio during the quarter. Net interest income increased $1.5 million, driven by lower interest expense directly related to the decrease in interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities. Linked quarter, our net interest margin increased five basis points to 3.03% from 2.98%. The margin benefited from lower deposit and funding costs, which more than offset negative impacts on lower rates on interest-earning assets. We had a 10 basis point increase in the net spread linked quarter to 2.76% as a result of the lower deposit and funding costs. We recorded $437,000 in loan accretion this quarter, an increase of $100,000 or 30% from the prior quarter.\n\nNoninterest income, excluding net gain on available for sale securities, decreased $466,000 or 4.5% for the linked quarter, primarily due to decreases in deposit services and trust fees. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, our noninterest expense decreased $424,000 or 1.4% for the linked quarter, primarily due to a $600,000 loss on disposition of certain assets recognized last quarter, offset with a small increase in salaries and employee benefits of $237,000. We used additional FDIC credits in the amount of $439,000 in the first quarter, and we had $327,000 in remaining credits. We have used excuse me, our efficiency ratio decreased to 51.91% compared to 53.87% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to the increase in net interest income. Income tax expense decreased $2.4 million or 83.2% linked quarter, driven primarily by the decrease in pre-tax income in the linked quarter increase in tax-free municipal income. Our effective tax rate decreased to 10.8% from 14.1% for the first quarter, primarily due to higher tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income than the prior quarter.\n\nAdditionally, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $52,000 or 1.2%, a more significant impact on the effective tax rate than usual due to the lower pre-tax income. Regarding our estimate on noninterest expense, absent COVID-19, we were estimating noninterest expense of approximately $30.5 million however, at this time, we expect it may be in the $31 million range for the second quarter. We do expect some additional overtime pay as a result of processing the PPP loans. At this time, we are estimating an effective tax rate of 12%. During the first quarter, we increased our stock repurchase plan authorization by an additional one million shares for a total authorization of two million shares. And purchased approximately 870,000 shares of our stock beginning bringing our total purchase to approximately 895,000 shares at an average price of $29.82. We have not purchased any shares subsequent to March 31, and approximately 1.1 million shares remain authorized for purchase.\n\nThank you for joining us today. This concludes our comments, and we will open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps with Piper Sandler.\n\nBrad Milsaps -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning guys. Good morning. Julie, I was writing quickly when you were sort of running through some of the loan portfolio stats. Just curious if you could go over again that I think were you giving exposure to hotel and restaurant and energy? Or is that as a percentage of the deferrals that you had granted? But I'm curious to know kind of what the total exposure would be to sort of some of those kind of higher risk category, hotel, restaurant, retail, CRE and energy.\n\nJulie N. Shamburger, C.P.A. -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure. Okay. To be clear, in what I was stating in my script was referring to the deferrals. So did you get all of those percentages?\n\nBrad Milsaps -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nWould love for you to run through those maybe one more time, and then the actual the composition would be great, too.\n\nJulie N. Shamburger, C.P.A. -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nOkay, sure. Okay. Specifically to the deferrals, 29% private households, 22% hotels, 17% commercial real estate and 5% restaurants. And then with respect to the portfolio...\n\nRetail investment real estate is 9%; and hotels are at 2%; retail trade, 2%; and food and restaurants at 2%; for a total with oil and gas of 17%.\n\nBrad Milsaps -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nOkay, great. That's very helpful. And then, Lee, maybe just moving to the balance sheet. Obviously, a lot of movement at the end of the quarter that wasn't necessarily reflected in kind of what you earned in the first quarter. Is it fair to say you would expect a pretty big boost in NII in the second quarter, even excluding PPP, but your margin will see some contraction? Just kind of curious kind of what yield were the bonds that you bought that came on during the quarter? Just trying to get a sense of kind of what's going to go on in the margin.\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe bonds that we've put on in March, the yield was a tax equivalent yield was at 3.22%. And the funding, we locked in at $400 million at 32 basis points. So roughly, there's a spread there of about 2.9%. So yes, we will see and most of that occurred in the last probably 20 to 15 to 20 days of March.\n\nBrad Milsaps -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nGreat. And I know the some of the existing borrowings that you have on the books are swapped also with LIBOR. Are there any other big pieces that are coming due over the near term that you could benefit from, being able to lower the rate on?\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. We have on our public funds, some of those are tied to tax pool. The tax pool rate in March, I think, averaged right around 1%. And I think it's around for April, it's going to be about 45 basis points. And those balances are, what, Julie, about $250 million, $300 million, somewhere in that range? And then a lot of those the brokerage CDs that are rolling off were basically going to Home Loan Bank. And then we also are borrowing from Fed on the PPP loans at the 25 basis points. And then all of our retail deposits, they have come down. The higher tiers have all come down pretty significantly.\n\nBrad Milsaps -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Great. So kind of in the interim, you'll let the higher-cost stuff run off and maybe lean into the wholesale Federal Home Loan Bank advances until things can stabilize?\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Young with SunTrust.\n\nI wanted to maybe just start on capital. You mentioned I know you all authorized kind of a share buyback late in the first quarter, which you were active on, but then you stopped subsequent to the quarter end. How should we think about that on a go-forward basis? Maybe what things are you kind of watching to decide whether to proceed with the remainder of that versus not?\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nI think we're going to watch the price of the stock. And we have that in our back pocket. Our capital levels, when you look at total capital, especially on our risk base from a risk-based standpoint, are extremely good. So we've got that in our back pocket. And if it makes sense, we'll pick up repurchasing some shares again.\n\nMichael Young -- SunTrust -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And maybe just overall margin this quarter, were there any significant prepayment fees or anything else running through the margin that aided it further this quarter that we shouldn't expect to recur going forward on a core basis?\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nNo. No, there was really nothing unusual in the quarter other than interest rates just dropping significantly, short-term down close to 0.\n\nMichael Young -- SunTrust -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And then the last one for me, maybe just on the specific portfolios you mentioned, specifically CRE or construction, and some of the more at-risk areas. Could you give us a sense for sort of the underwriting criteria that you all stick to, and, what, maybe some of the LTVs or debt service coverage ratios would be in those books if you have that available?\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe equity we typically look for in CRE is at least 30%, if not 40%, and it really depends on if there's a guarantor or not. And the strength of the guarantor, we do have some that have more equity than that, but that's not the typical thing. On the debt service coverage, for the most part, it has to have a 125% debt service coverage ratio. And those are basically the things that we look for. And we stress them to make sure that under different stress scenarios, they're able to meet certain things.\n\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brady Gailey with SunTrust KBW\n\nBrady Gailey -- SunTrust KBW -- Analyst\n\nSo It's actually Brady Gailey with KBW. So on the bond purchases, it sounds like you saw an opportunity with the dislocation in the bond market and took advantage. How do you think about additional bond purchases from here?\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo everything's pretty tight right now. The reason we went for munis was we could lock in a bond that we didn't have to worry about prepaying because of the call protection. We'll continue to look for things out there, but it's pretty tight right now. Munis have tightened in quite a bit from the mid-March levels. Mortgages are just razor-thin at this point in time with the Fed buying as much as they are. So we'll be that's the main reason we jumped in and bought basically the asset growth we were looking for, for the year.\n\nBrady Gailey -- SunTrust KBW -- Analyst\n\nAll right. And then you mentioned the $10 million of pre-tax earnings from the PPP loans. That looks like about 330 basis points of fees or gains. When would you expect to realize that? It seems like most of those loans will be forgiven within the next quarter or two. So is it right to think about that $10 million will flow through spread income in the next, call it, two quarters?\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nI think so. I think we don't know exactly how much of it's going to run through, but we're guessing close to 90% of it is going to run through. And if it does run through in this quarter, it will probably be the last 15 days of the quarter. But I think the bulk of it probably is and it really just depends on what the processes SBA has and how if it is as slow as getting loans on, it may be well into July getting them prepaid. If that's helpful, I mean, we're thinking that whatever is going to be prepaid, probably 95% of it's going to happen by the end of July. There'll be very little that trickles past that, I would guess.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Would you like to make closing remarks?\n\nLee R. Gibson III, C.P.A. -- President And Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. Well, thank you for being on the call today. And given Southside's experienced management team, along with having entered the crisis with strong asset quality, capital, liquidity and low levels of nonperforming assets, we believe we're well positioned to deal with the challenges ahead.\n\nThank you for joining us today. We look forward to reporting second quarter results in July.

But it's still paying roughly the same to borrow as Illinois, once the tax breaks on the state's debts are factored in.\n\nA steady drumbeat of headlines about plunging tax revenue, massive budget deficits and sky-high unemployment are pushing yields to emerging-market levels for some of America's most financially stressed municipal borrowers.\n\nThe MTA, which is facing a $8.5 billion budget deficit after the coronavirus decimated ridership, offered 30-year bonds Tuesday at a yield of 5.2%, tax-exempt, the equivalent to more than 10% on a taxable basis for New York investors in the highest tax-bracket. Mexico's economy is reeling from a combination of a plunge in oil prices and declines in exports and tourism. Its 30-year U.S. denominated debt yields 5.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, Illinois's 10-year bonds are trading at 5.7%, akin to a taxable bond yield of 9.3%, roughly the same as Ukraine's dollar denominated debt with the same maturity. Illinois's economy is several time larger than that of Ukraine, which is still at war with Russia. And Illinois, like other states, can't go bankrupt, nor has it ever defaulted on its debts.\n\nThe municipal-bond market \"is being hit by these headlines and confusion on what municipal credit is like,\" said Dan Solender, head of municipals at Lord Abbett & Co. \"The MTA, they have a lot of cash, they have a lot of government support. As soon as things open up, whether people love the idea or not, they're going to use the subway to get around New York.\"\n\nEven though state and local government debt is one of the world's safest investments, the individual investors who dominate the market are still prone to so-called headline risk, or bad news stories that undermine the market's well-deserved reputation as a haven.\n\nFrom 1970 through 2018, the average five-year annual default rate for municipal bonds was 0.09%, according to Moody's Investors Service. Corporate bonds, which have lower ratings, had a 6.6% default rate over the same period.\n\nDebt costs are typically a relatively small percentage of a state's or city's overall budget and is fully amortizing, like a mortgage. Corporations and nations that borrow money that must be paid in one lump sum when the debt comes due may be more vulnerable to rapid shifts in market sentiment.\n\nIllinois spent about $1.8 billion in interest in 2019, a small share of the government's $81.5 billion budget, according to the most recent audited financial statements.\n\nWhile the MTA's ridership has declined 95%, it has about $3.2 billion in cash, reserves and lines of credit to provide a bridge until it can secure more state and federal aid or find other fixes for its deficit, according to bond offering documents. The MTA received $3.8 billion from the federal CARES Act and has asked for an additional $3.9 billion. Barring more aid, the MTA would have to make politically difficult choices to cut essential services or raise fares, take on more debt, or defer critical infrastructure spending.\n\nAaron Donovan, an MTA spokesman, declined to comment on Tuesday's sale.\n\nEven so, New York state law specifically prohibits the MTA and its subsidiaries from filing for bankruptcy and the authority must pay debt before using revenue for operations.\n\nMixed messages from Washington on more aid for states and cities is giving investors pause, Solender said. Democrats want to send as much as $1 trillion in more aid to deal with the fallout from the coronavirus, while Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has voiced support for giving state's the power to file bankruptcy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Illinois delayed the planned auction of $1.2 billion of short-term debt after its yield penalties surged to record highs.\n\n\"Given this environment, given the confusion and uncertainty, those are the kinds of yields they need to pay to raise money,\" Solender said.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-05T18:55:00Z", "uri": "6057015364", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-05/fear-drives-mta-illinois-bond-yields-to-emerging-market-heights"}], "6056907401": [615347313, {"pk": 615347313, "name": "A Market in Suspension & an Economy in Despair | ETF Trends", "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "text": "A frothy market with questionable growth prospects has been required to take a time out. How, and when, our economy will reopen remains unknown. The best-case scenario at the moment appears to be reaching herd immunity by Q2 of 2021, most likely with a vaccine. We wouldn't set a schedule to that, as it seems like a too-good-to-be-true timeline with a high possibility of delay. What the reopening of the economy will look like in the next 3 quarters remains unknown. What is known is step 1: removal of the 'stay home' order. The next comment may sound uncanny given the current environment, but all things considered, markets have priced in a pretty flawless execution of the next 9 months consisting of seamless coordination between states, countries, nations, central banks, corporations, and scientists needed to get there. Intentions and execution don't always line up. Additionally, consumers need to receive stimulus checks before they get evicted, especially if we expect consumers to feel comfortable spending big during the traditional high spending back to school/Black Friday/ holiday seasons.\n\nThe COVID-19 Fiscal and Monetary policy was put together in just a few weeks; in the 2008 recession, it took upwards of 9 months. What is the biggest difference between 2020 and 2008? 2008 was a top down liquidity crisis that filtered down to affect all members of the economy. This recession, thus far, has only significantly affected low income workers, creative workers and gig economy workers, leaving most others unscathed. The market in suspension has only affected Main Street - Wall Street is eagerly waiting for the merry-go-round to turn back on. The ominous federal reserve \"put\" has been shown in full force.\n\nComing into this year, we wrote that the S&P 500 appeared expensive; not exceptionally so when measured by traditional metrics such as P/E, but at record levels when measured by its PEG ratio. This gave us muted growth expectations for the following 3 to 5 years (pre COVID-19). Given where yields are/were, growth prospects on a 60/40 were already muted.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index lost 30% faster than the Great Depression, Black Monday, or 2008. Was the market pullback an over-reaction? In our opinion it was not. There was no way to expect the swiftness or magnitude of stimulus, and there is still so much uncertainty about the coming months. As hard as it is to believe now, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet was unwinding just 9 months ago. As of August 2019, the Fed had unwound about $750 billion from their balance sheet over an 18-month period. Since then, we've added $2.75 trillion, with almost $2.5 trillion coming in response to COVID-19. The entire quantitative easing (QE) decade peaked at $4.5 trillion in assets on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet prior to 2020. Here is some information to put those billions and trillions into perspective: the gross domestic product (GDP) of the US economy in 2019 was 21.4 trillion dollars. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was $2.28 trillion - approximately 10.8% of US GDP.\n\nUS Initial Jobless Claims SA (yellow), US Continuing Jobless Claims SA (white)\n\nWeekly initial jobless claims are above 4 million (down from 7 million). We peaked at 6.5 million total claims in 2009 with weekly claims peaking at 661,000. As of now, that number is almost 16 million. In past commentaries, we've frequently written about the US economy's reliance on consumption, and how over-stretched many participants in the economy are. We've also discussed the behavioral psyche of those who expect a bigger, better and more robust economy - and how fragile that psyche can be. Stimulus or not, the US is still a consumption-driven economy. Lots of research has shown the effects of a recession on consumption patterns and the people's desire to save. Unemployment is expected to be in the teens, and Q2 GDP could be as bad as -25%; nothing that foreshadows a raging return of the consumer.\n\nThe Fiscal & Monetary policy is supporting the greater market, but time truly is the devil here. Every industry is different. Some can last a few months, and a partial opening of the economy will suffice. Others need the economy at full steam to have any chance of survival. A few are complete zombies.\n\nWe wrote about \"Zombies, in your Index\" in our weekly market updates. A zombie industry is one that will rely on government intervention to survive the current work from home (WFH) world we exist in. We identified 25 industries that we believe have been mortally wounded by the work and consumption changes brought about by COVID-19.\n\nThese industries make up almost 15% of broader markets outside of the top 100 companies in the US. The Zombie reading on the S&P 500 is only 4.84% due to their large weighting compared to the top companies. Luckily, these industries don't contribute greatly to the bottom line of markets, comprising only around 7% of S&P 500 earnings.\n\nWe recently wrote about how huge the world's biggest companies actually seem when compared to the rest of the market. This year has only widened the gap. This difference does not lead to competitive markets, and QE only increases the discrepancy between companies who have limitless access to debt, and those who don't.\n\nIn 1817, the lack of horses led to the invention of the first bicycle. In 1894, the Great Horse Manure Crisis, that left most major cities drowning in horse manure, sped up use of cars; 18 years later, horses were almost completely replaced by motor vehicles. As the masses flocked to the internet in response to the Chinese SARS epidemic, companies such as Alibaba saw a turning point in internet usage. For COVID-19, it appears to be video conferencing platforms, contactless payments, online education, 3-D printing, genomic sequencing and analysis, cloud storage, Ecommerce and more. The adoption of these technologies has significantly sped up during quarantine, but we expect these changes to define how we do business and communication in the future as well. PayPal was the first non-bank to gain approval to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program. Additionally, Square and PayPal's Cash Apps can (without FDIC protection) offer those without bank accounts access to stimulus checks faster. COVID-19 is redefining what counts as a bank in the US. Independent professionals are seeing more traction than ever before, and online marketplaces for freelancers, like Fiverr and Upwork, are gaining more traffic. Businesses are now considering \"germ scores\" on transactions with consumers; they've found that credit cards are dirtier than cash, NYC Citi bikes, and McDonald's bathrooms. In a world where specialization and optimization, for the sake of perpetual margin increase, drove stock prices for decades, innovation is now key.\n\nYour rebalancing strategy is more important than ever. In the midst of COVID-19, many large, \"passive\" indexes had to actively decide to postpone rebalances right when the work-from-home shift began. Rebalancing based on portfolio drift is ideal, and in a volatile market with many potential swings, this strategy comes with benefits. How will dividend achievers' indexes fair? Will low volatility surpass large-cap growth, even after all the outperformance? In the world of asset management, track record length is important. However, certain areas of the ETF marketplace are exempt from this general rule.\n\nHave we learned the dangers of misused leverage hidden in parts of the economy, and the ticking time bomb these create if growth/consumption don't continue steadily upward? Has the fed learned lessons from the past and overcome market recessions (at least in duration), even if the economy will have its traditional cycles? The Federal Reserve certainly learned to act quicker; a and with magnitude, and as far as leverage, as we mentioned in our last commentary, leverage has just gotten more creative. From an allocator's perspective, the most important message is that the Federal Reserve will do anything to protect markets.\n\nUS equities are still expensive, yet still crucial for the global economy. While we admit earnings expectations going out 3 to 5 years from now is somewhat a game of darts, we are still near all-time highs and expect expectations to be overshot if anything. Outside of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet & Facebook, thematic ETFs provide the best access to growth. 30% of the Russell 3000 has negative earnings, and as we mentioned earlier, extreme QE only benefits the largest companies. Mid- and small-caps have significantly underperformed, and we don't expect that to change. We see value in financials, and would stay away from energy. Be wary of older index structures that may not be relevant these days. Car companies, considered consumer discretionary, are no longer just exposed to the raw materials of cars and end sales; they are financing arm companies exposed to consumer credit. Similarly, tech companies are also finance companies, and financials are also technology companies.\n\nThe shift in innovation adoption has caused many asset classes to appear less volatile than they actually are. This is why we think now is the most important time to review old index structures that may exist in your portfolio (think what this might do to some of the most basic low volatility indexes). While we believe many stocks have fared well in 2020 thus far, and will continue to do so, their volatility has been understated. Market disruptions lead them to potentially increase revenue growth in the coming 3-5 years, unlike most other industries. This is no clearer than in the emerging market space ,which we will touch on momentarily, and shouldn't be a reason not to invest. In fact, we strongly recommend it in the emerging market space; we are just commenting on the subdued volatility some growth categories have experienced thus far.\n\nReiterating from our last commentary, it's hard to get excited about a value play on Nestle. Although this is mostly a joke, it underlines two primary issues with international developed equities: lack of broader innovation, and lack of unity. Lack of unity provides reason to expect perpetual delay of the Fiscal and Monetary policy. The European Union just isn't as strong and does not have the history that the United States has. We are most concerned about broad indexes in this space, and would instead recommend using active managers or thematic exposures.\n\nEmerging market Internet of Things (IOT) outperformed broader emerging markets by over 14% this year; WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (ex-SOE) outperformed broader EM by about 3%. In our last commentary, we predicted that within 5 years, either Tencent or Alibaba (possibly both) would approach the Trillionaire's club, currently consisting of Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon. We're not necessarily saying that they will be worth over a trillion (though they may), just that the gap between the Chinese tech giants and US tech giants would close. These companies do have the size to benefit from global QE, and similarly, our tech giants are using times of market disruption to ease into other industries.\n\nThe iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) returned 3.06% for the quarter, while the iShares iBoxx $ High-Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) returned -11.89%. Long term treasuries were up over 30%. But that doesn't truly explain volatility increase in fixed income markets. The third week in March was met with more outflows in bond mutual funds and ETFs than ever experienced in history - even surpassing 2008. Overall, ETFs did exactly what they were designed to do, with a few bad actors due to structure issues. It's clear the Federal Reserve will do everything in its power to keep bond markets moving smoothly. This stems from the fact that the Fed now buys corporate and high-yield bond ETFs, and supports municipal bonds. High-yield was dragged down by the energy sector, which we warned about in our last commentary, but spreads have widened in many industries of the high-yield space. default rates are still the key here. The length of the stay-at-home order and eventual return to semi-normalcy will dictate any significant changes in defaults.\n\nWe have reached oil storage capacity. The Saudi-Russian trade war came right as the economy shut down and oil consumption crashed. Tankers are full - if you have room for it, someone may actually pay you to pick up oil in Oklahoma. We don't think oil will ever trade above $60 again, leaving many oil exporting countries in trouble.\n\nWe continue to recommend a mixed alternative bucket consisting of long-term treasuries, gold, and AGFiQ US Market Neutral Anti-Beta Fund (BTAL). All 3 are up double digits this year. If you can access crypto, adding Bitcoin into this mix would also help , despite the complex execution. Bitcoin is up 24% YTD in response to massive global QE. This year, we were able to rebalance between our alternatives and equities at market dislocations mid March, which was very beneficial for YTD returns.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe continue to recommend a barbell approach to risks within asset classes (think equities and fixed income), and for the entire portfolio. The names below are definitely more volatile than traditional broad indexes, but we see more and more value in seeking the non-traditional in these markets.\n\nA hypothetical high-active-share reconstruction of a traditional 60/40:\n\nInvestment Trends\n\no Many companies will change their policy on 5-days a week for employees forever\n\no Cheaper than owning, cleaner than public transportation\n\nFinal Thoughts on the Economy\n\nWe live in a consumer economy, and we are marketed as consumers everywhere we go. For the first time since World War II, we've been asked to stay at home and take care of ourselves, not live in the convenience economy. Even when the economy reopens, we do not think that US consumption will be back in full stride for a few years. Markets expect a full consumption recovery at some point in the next 18-24 months. Fiscal and Monetary policy will continually support the economy until that point. Any change in either would be bad for markets (if public pushes back on potential industry bailouts, etc).\n\nDisclaimer: This commentary is distributed for informational and educational purposes only and is not intended to constitute legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

We have therefore updated the characters of the game which can be played for free without registration here.\n\n\"There's an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve\" - Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, March 23\n\n\"When it comes to this lending, we're not going to run out of ammunition, that doesn't happen\" - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, March 26\n\nOver the last two months, major central banks and governments across the globe have unleashed a series of monetary and fiscal interventions on markets and economies which are unprecedented in their magnitude and which are boarding on the destruction of the current financial system.\n\nWhile the global spread of coronavirus COVID-19 provided the trigger and the pretext for the current full-spectrum quantitative easing, money printing, asset purchases and economic bailouts, the size and scope of the current assault on free markets makes all previous central bank and government interventions look insignificance in comparison.\n\nMarkets are now officially broken. In some cases, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have become the markets, such is the scale of their asset buying, and their actions are making the bailouts of 2008 and 1998's Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) look like a walk in the park.\n\nFrom quantitative easing to zero bound interest rate cuts and beyond, from helicopter money to economy wide bailouts, the combined monetary and fiscal interference in markets and economies over recent weeks has now distorted everything from market prices to risk preferences to the time value of money, while shattering the concept of freely trading markets and free enterprise.\n\nAll of this in an environment of locked down economies, minimal economic activity, huge job losses, shrinking tax revenue and economic stagnation, as well as the impending approach of an unprecedented global recession, that if long lasting, will become a depression.\n\nOn the monetary side, the renewed and limitless quantitative easing - with central banks creating money out of thin air to buy up financial assets across all risk categories - combined with interest rate distortions, is both prolonging the very asset bubbles that the same central banks themselves created, while also leading to explosive increases in money supply. This in turn is leading to the destruction of currency values, and most worryingly, setting the scene for the real possibility of hyperinflation.\n\nOn the fiscal side, government stimulus packages of direct payments and loan and tax write-offs across vast swathes of economic sectors is not only creating a future dependence on income support and a pretext for the introduction of direct transfers to individuals, but is burdening the very same workforces with future tax burdens and even more debt.\n\nIn this scenario, helicopter money, analogous to a helicopter dropping cash directly to the population, comes into play. Essentially helicopter cash represents direct methods of boosting consumer demand by the distribution of currency directly to the public into their bank accounts and into their pockets. Like quantitative easing, direct cash drops pave the way for destruction of currencies and can be the touch-paper to trigger hyperinflation.\n\nImportantly, on both the monetary and fiscal fronts, the sheer flood of official interventions across markets and economies is now creating the largest moral hazard problem the world has ever seen, with investors and economic actors being conditioned to the expectation that central banks and governments will always come to the rescue by propping up asset prices and bailing out entire sectors (think banks, airlines and real estate), thus creating an environment that encourages a lack of individual consequences for future risky behavior, but at the same time creating dire consequences for the collective financial and economic system.\n\nWhile the scale of what is happening right is daunting and difficult to keep track of, a ballpark estimate suggests that the total size of interventions from just some of the world's largest monetary and fiscal authorities is currently more than US $10 trillion and counting. For a taste for how uncharted and dangerous this QE is becoming, a quick look at the US and Europe is instructive.\n\nAfter cutting interest rates to zero via two emergency decisions during March (March 3 here and March 15 here), the US Federal Reserve then announced on 15 March that over the coming months it would ramp up QE by buying at least $500 billion of US Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThat's $700 billion of Fed debt buying from banks and the Treasury across a cross section of widening of risk categories. At the same time, the Fed begun flooding the Fed system with credit in an attempt to boost liquidity, including $1 trillion in repurchase operations per day.\n\nWhen this didn't placate markets, the Fed then went 'all in' on 23 March and announced the start of open-ended quantitative easing (QE) in unlimited amounts, to buy an even wider range of debt from low to much higher risk classes, promising to:\n\n\"purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed...including purchases of corporate and municipal bonds.\"\n\nThe Fed then also established swap lines with a whole range of major central banks around the world, providing these central banks with dollar funding in exchange for US Treasuries. This in essence expands the money supply of US dollars all over the world.\n\nThen on 9 April the Fed was back, announcing another $2.3 trillion in QE, in the form of $600 billion purchases of bank loans of individuals and businesses, $500 billion buying of municipal bonds and loans (states, cities etc), and $850 billion in QE related to credit facilities of US corporates and asset-backed vehicles. Incredibly, this includes junk bonds and junk bond ETFs, with such market euphemisms as high yield, extended yield, and beyond investment grade. There is therefore, it seems, no limit to the depths the US Fed will go in its quest to prop up prices, bail out Wall St banks and hedge funds, and destroy financial markets.\n\nNot surprisingly, this new unprecedented and unlimited QE by the Fed over March and April can already be seen in the huge explosion in US money supply, where the monetary aggregate measure M2 (which includes cash, demand deposits, time deposits and money market mutual funds) has rocketed higher from the new money \"out of thin air\" that has no bearing on underlying economic growth. This can be seen in the below Federal Reserve chart. As a closely watched indicator in forecasting future inflation, this M2 chart speaks volumes.\n\nIn the same vein, as architect of this rampant QE, the money out of thin air hits the Fed's bottom line,showing up in the rapid expansion of the Fed's balance sheet, which has ballooned from $ 4.17 trillion at the end of February to $6.4 trillion now. That's an insane $2.2 trillion added since the start of March, or in other words", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-05T01:51:00Z", "uri": "6056135583", "url": "https://www.sgtreport.com/2020/05/qe-defender-stop-the-qe-insanity-helicopter-money-and-the-risk-of-hyperinflation/"}], "6056048625": [872950516, {"pk": 872950516, "name": "EDITORIAL  |  Make a deal on a state bonding bill", "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "text": "Republicans should work with Walz to craft a bill that will help Minnesota's economy recover.\n\nWhen Minnesota's governor and Legislature cobble together a bonding bill, it's usually a struggle over how much the state is keen to borrow to replace roads and bridges, upgrade state university buildings or rehab low-income and senior housing. The 2020 wish list is 50 pages long.\n\nDemocrats talk of borrowing billions. Republicans counter with figures that have fewer zeros.\n\nTrue to form, Gov. Tim Walz is pushing for a $2.6 billion bonding bill this session, casting the spending as a stimulus counterweight to fast-disappearing private sector jobs and income. Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka has said $755 million is more like it, though he's left open the prospect of borrowing more.\n\nComplicating matters further, state House Republicans vow to block long-term borrowing measures until the governor lifts a pandemic stay-at-home order and other emergency steps now set to expire May 18. That's the day the Legislature is set to adjourn -- with or without a bonding bill.\n\n\"It's important that the Legislature be involved in the decisionmaking process\" on the pandemic response, said House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown.\n\nGazelka said Monday he would not hold up a bonding legislation over Walz's emergency powers, but to pass the House a bill would need six GOP votes.\n\nA quick compromise to get the bonding bill back on track should be a top priority for Walz and legislators of both parties.\n\nCircumstances are changing fast. This year, the sparring may be as much about how much the financial markets are willing to lend as about how much the state is prepared to borrow. The state will have to be disciplined in its debt decisions based on that new reality. It also may have to look beyond taxes for the means to repay.\n\nWalz is right to portray shovel-ready projects as important stimulus to the state economy at a time when legions of workers have lost employment that may not return in restaurants, hospitality, tourism, entertainment and other industries where packing people together is key to economic success. \"Jobs, jobs, jobs\" should be a theme of capital spending plans.\n\nMaking wise borrowing choices will be more important than ever, however. Sporting a sterling AAA credit rating may not be enough for Minnesota to escape a rising cost of borrowing during a period of bond market tumult.\n\nIt's easy to understand why investors may be skittish about buying municipal bonds. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rattled markets with talk of sending state and local governments into bankruptcy. The loose talk raises specters of default on debts -- a blow already struck in a few cases.\n\nCollapsing revenue will make raising taxes counterproductive. That means the state may have to consider imposing user fees as a strategy for assuring bonds are repaid.\n\nWant $55 million to plan for metro rapid-transit bus routes? Fine. But maybe the fares will have to be a bit higher to repay that debt. How about $12.5 million for a new arena/expo center at Graham Park in Olmsted County? Sure. But shouldn't exhibitor fees help make payments on those bonds?\n\nThose who benefit most should be asked to shoulder some of the cost.\n\nThe state also should use a guiding principle of a well-run private business to pick and choose projects for the state bonding bill: What capital projects will offer the greatest measurable return on investment?\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that sprucing up a nature trail or installing a park community center won't make the cut. Another touchstone for making choices should be putting people back to work, in the manner of New Deal projects that left landmark legacies that have endured for 85 years.\n\nThe 2020 Minnesota bonding bill will be as much about shoring up the present as about shaping the future.

Here's where to look\n\nFor any readers less familiar, a junk bond is a bond that's riskier than what is called an \"investment grade\" bond. Specifically, the risk is that the issuing-company will default on its owed interest payments to investors.\n\nBecause of this risk of default, investors require a higher yield from junk bonds. This is to offset the greater risk these investors are assuming by lending their money to these risky companies.\n\nRecently, we've seen a surge of junk-bond issuances from cash-starved companies, reeling from the Coronavirus.\n\nHighlighting research from Eric Fry, last week's Digest noted how estimates are pegging 2021 corporate default rates at more than 20%.\n\nIf that actually happens, it will be nothing short of staggering.\n\nEric's fear is that many investors who read headlines about the Fed buying junk bonds will mistake that as a greenlight for leaping headfirst into risky assets ... which may turn out quite badly.\n\nFrom Eric:\n\nUndoubtedly, many of these investors assume the Fed is providing an implicit guarantee to backstop the high-yield market. They believe the Fed has \"de-risked\" junk bonds and provided an opportunity to pick up additional risk-free return.\n\nThe reality, I predict, is that investors have picked up additional \"return-free risk,\" to borrow a clever phrase from Jim Grant.\n\nEric's bottom-line takeaway was clear: stay away from high-yield junk.\n\n***Now, while there's growing danger in \"junk,\" there's growing opportunity in quality bonds -- so says our resident income expert, Neil George\n\nAs the editor of Profitable Investing, Neil specializes in finding his subscribers big income, whether through high-yielding dividend-stocks, bonds, REITs, MLPs, or more obscure investment vehicles.\n\nRecently, Neil has been eyeing high-quality corporate and municipal bonds. And last week, he updated his subscribers on the opportunities he's seeing today.\n\nFrom Neil:\n\nWhile March brought some massive upheavals to these sectors as plunging stocks brought panic selling of everything in the quest for cash, there's a lot of value in both of these sectors ...\n\nWith the market shocks and gyrations in March, the spread between municipal bonds and corporate bond yields over Treasuries has spiked. The last time we had such a spike was during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\nYields for Municipal (White) & Treasuries (Gold) & Spread (Green) -- Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P. & Barclays\n\nYields for Corporates (White) & Treasuries (Gold) & Spread (Green) -- Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P. & Barclays\n\nThis means there are significant yield opportunities to buy right now. And as both municipal bond and corporate bond prices are down with the yields up, they make for great opportunities for gains as the markets further normalize.\n\nAt this point in his update, Neil directs readers toward the Fed's massive U.S. corporate and municipal bonds purchases. The purpose of these buys is to stabilize the bond and credit markets, while also driving down yields and credit costs for corporations, municipalities, and other debt issuers.\n\nBack to Neil:\n\nThis means both segments and others have a major buyer that underpins prices ...\n\nThe past has shown how corporates and munis profit with Fed actions. From the end of 2008 through the end of 2019, corporate and municipal bonds generated returns of 103.6% and 72.7%, respectively.\n\nMunicipal (White) & Corporate (Orange) Bond Indexes Total Return -- Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P. & Barclays\n\n***Backing up, is it safe to be buying corporate and municipal bonds in light of the lurking dangers?\n\nAfter all, if the high-yield market is holding some toxic assets as Eric Fry noted, how easily could that contagion spill over into the investment-grade and municipal markets?\n\nWell, let's establish some broad historical context as we answer this.\n\nBack to Neil:\n\nBonds have a history of working for both income and growth. In the U.S., the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index compiles the overall U.S. bond market. Over the trailing 20 years, it has generated a return of 174.8%.\n\nWhile a little short of the S&P 500 Index's return of 199%, it achieved that growth with a lot less drama.\n\nBonds vs. Stocks: US Aggregate (White) & S&P 500 (Orange) Total Return -- Source: Bloomberg Finance, L.P.\n\nThat's why I continue to recommend buying bonds and, specifically, U.S. corporate bonds and municipal bonds.\n\nThat relatively smooth growth curve, even over turbulent stretches in the market, is hard to argue with. But let's argue anyway ...\n\nAs you likely recall, 2008/2009 saw the U.S. economy pushed to the brink of collapse. How did bonds hold up then?\n\nWell, it depends on which bonds you're talking about.\n\nFrom MarketWatch:\n\nThe number of companies who defaulted on their debt reached a record high in 2009, more than doubling from 2008 as the recession weighed heavily on companies with below-investment grade ratings, according to Standard & Poor's ...\n\nThe speculative-grade corporate default rate in the U.S. was 11% at the end of 2009. The investment-grade default rate was 0.34% at the end of 2009, with only five companies defaulting. It was higher in 2008, at 0.73%.\n\nSo, even at the worst point in the financial crisis, quality investment grade bonds managed to keep defaults beneath 1%.\n\nPerhaps the easiest head-to-head comparison of investment grade defaults versus junk defaults comes from the Corporate Finance Institute:\n\nHistorically, investment-grade bonds witness a low default rate compared to non-investment grade bonds.\n\nFor example, S&P Global reported that the highest one-year default rate for AAA, AA, A, and BBB-rated bonds (investment-grade bonds) were 0%, 0.38%, 0.39%, and 1.02%, respectively.\n\nIt can be contrasted with the maximum one-year default rate for BB, B, and CCC/C-rated bonds (non-investment-grade bonds) of 4.22%, 13.84%, and 49.28%, respectively.\n\nHere he is with his investment grade corporate bond fund ideas:\n\nTwo bond funds to buy right now include the BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ) and the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT).\n\nBoth have impressive collections of U.S. corporate bonds, with BlackRock actively managing the actual bonds, while Vanguard does it synthetically following the BlackRock & Barclays Index. And remember, BlackRock is under contract with the Fed to oversee bond buying ...\n\nVCIT yields 2.9% and is a buy in a tax-free account.\n\nBTZ is a closed-end fund and trades at a discount to net asset value (NAV) now of 6.9%, making for an even bigger bargain. Yielding 7.8%, BTZ is a buy in a tax-free account.\n\nAnd here are Neil's thoughts on munis:\n\nI also have a collection of municipal bond funds within the portfolios of Profitable Investing, including the BlackRock Municipal Income Trust II (BLE), which is at a discount to NAV. It sports a taxable equivalent yield of 8.2% and is a buy in a taxable account.\n\nAnother one of my favorite bond ETFs is the Nuveen Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond ETF (TFI). It yields a taxable equivalent 3.1% and tracks the leading muni index. TFI is a buy in a taxable account.\n\nWrapping up, there's money to be made in bonds -- but there are also landmines to avoid.

Since its founding in 2014 with $110 million of capital that grew to $1.7 billion in 2018, its transaction originations steadily rose, increasing by 37% in 2017 and 34% in 2018. Nuveen is a global asset manager, with municipal bonds forming a subset of its various asset classes with fixed-income assets under management of $150 billion.\n\nSome broker-dealers appeared in the recorded calls willing to bow to Nuveen's demands while others did not.\n\nWhen PHC filed the case in late February it cracked the window open on the cutthroat competition in the high-yield municipal market. Its accusations sparked debate on the accusations of whether strong-arm tactics broke the law, broker-dealer complicity and resistance, and what constitutes pricing fairness. The case dragged top-tier firms into the fray along with top banking officials who were subpoenaed.\n\nDuring the Chancery Court proceedings last year, Nuveen had argued all's fair in a competitive marketplace and worked to recast what PHC called illegal tactics to damage its business as simple reminders to banks and broker-dealers of their wish to be among the first to see deals. The judge rejected those arguments.\n\nThe Delaware Chancery Court last month concluded that Nuveen intentionally interfered with Preston Hollow's business relations but Nuveen won't face any sanctions beyond a stinging assessment of its tactics from the judge.\n\nVice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III had declined to rule on an anti-competitive claim and previously dismissed the defamation claim over technical reasons saying it required a jury. Chancery Court cases are non-juried and decided by the judge alone. PHC last year filed the defamation claim in the Superior Court but it remained on hold pending the outcome of the original case before Glasscock. With the outcome now final, PHC filed the amended complaint.\n\nThe new complaint seeks compensatory damages of no less than $100 million and punitive damages to be determined by a jury as well as court costs and attorney fees.\n\nThe amended complaint lays out the evidence from recorded calls presented during the Chancery Court proceedings, naming some Nuveen officials that previously were referenced as unnamed individuals, broker-dealers and banks.\n\nPreston Hollow lays out the evidence presented at trial from the recordings that it believes proves its defamation accusation as Miller and other Nuveen officials accused PHC of \"predatory lending practices,\" suggested it was a risky counterparty, accused the firm of fleecing Roosevelt in one call, and questioned a lack of protective covenants in deals and rushing transactions, and claims PHC took advantage of unsophisticated borrowers. Nuveen officials also told one bank that \"unethical practices\" had caught the attention of states' attorney generals who had contacted PHC.\n\nPHC said it never received any such contact. \"These statements were either intentionally false or manifested reckless disregard for the truth in order to harm Preston Hollow's business\" and made without \"any good faith basis,\" the complaint reads.\n\nPHC seeks to make its case of the impact of the alleged defamation. Since its founding in 2014 with $110 million of capital that grew to $1.7 billion in 2018, its transaction originations steadily rose, increasing by 37% in 2017 and 34% in 2018. Nuveen is a global asset manager, with municipal bonds forming a subset of its various asset classes with fixed-income assets under management of $150 billion.\n\nNuveen's alleged defamation escalated throughout 2018 and PHC claims it reached a peak as the firm secured transactions for Roosevelt University's which directly placed a $200 million issue and Howard University's $32 million issue in late 2018.\n\n\"Having missed out on the opportunity to invest in the university bonds, Miller and his staff at Nuveen engaged in a campaign of slander and intimidation to coerce and prevent broker-dealers from doing business with Preston Hollow,\" the complaint charges.\n\nSince then the pipeline has slowed.\n\n\"Preston Hollow saw a drastic reduction in inquiries and interaction with broker-dealers beginning in January 2019. This loss of business has caused significant economic harm to Preston Hollow,\" the complaint reads. \"Most of the leading broker-dealers in the industry either have ceased working with Preston Hollow on 100% placements or will do so only if Preston Hollow originates the transactions,\" PHC said in the complaint.\n\nThe firm had also been in \"discussions\" with Goldman Sachs on at least 12 transactions but since the alleged defamation \"all discussions with Goldman\" ceased. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe original case wrapped up with Glasscock's 59-page April 9 opinion. \"I find that Nuveen used threats and lies in a successful attempt to damage the plaintiff in its business relationships,\" Glasscock wrote. \"The record, taken as a whole, shows consistent, systematic efforts by Nuveen to shut down Preston Hollow's ability to continue to do business.\"\n\nBut the court concluded the relief sought by PHC -- banning Nuveen from future interference -- was not available and he also declined to rule on a count alleging anti-trust violations under New York State's Donnelly Act on legal reasons. Two other counts were previously dismissed, including the defamation claim that is the subject of the amended complaint before the Superior Court.\n\n\"We are pleased the court did not grant any injunction against Nuveen, and we continue to fully support John Miller and his entire team, who can continue delivering strong investment performance on behalf of our clients,\" Nuveen spokeswoman Jessica Greaney said in a statement last month. \"However, we respectfully disagree with the court's finding that Nuveen tortiously interfered with Preston Hollow's business. John and his team remain motivated by a desire to protect client investments while also supporting a fully transparent municipal-bond market for all participants.\"\n\nPreston Hollow said the opinion gave it the vindication it had sought and will help make its case with prospective banking and issuer clients. \"Preston Hollow Capital is gratified by the decision of the Delaware Chancery Court, which saw precisely what we saw: Nuveen's campaign of anti-competitive, untruthful, unfair and destructive conduct in the marketplace,\" PHC chairman and Chief Executive Jim Thompson said in statement.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-04T22:19:00Z", "uri": "6055994371", "url": "https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/preston-hollow-capital-presses-ahead-with-defamation-lawsuit-against-nuveen"}], "6055908269": [733780621, {"pk": 733780621, "name": "Mercury General Corp (MCY) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript | The Motley Fool", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "text": "Good afternoon. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mercury General Quarterly Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\n\nThis conference call may contain comments and forward-looking statements based on current plans, expectations, events, and financial and industry trends, which may affect Mercury General's future operating results and financial position. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, which cannot be predicted or quantified and which may cause future activities and results of operations to differ materially from those discussed here today.\n\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Gabriel Tirador. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you very much. I would like to welcome everyone to Mercury's first quarter conference call. I'm Gab Tirador, President and CEO. On the phone, we have Mr. George Joseph, Chairman; Ted Stalick, Senior Vice President and CFO; Jeff Schroeder, Vice President and Chief Product Officer; and Chris Graves, Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.\n\nBefore we take questions, we will make a few comments regarding the quarter.\n\nThe impact COVID-19 is having on the world is unprecedented. Our hearts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this crisis. I'd like to thank our 4,000-plus [Phonetic] team members for their efforts and resilience during this time. Our investments in technology over the past few years allowed us to smoothly transition our team members to work from home. We are fully functional and serving our customers and agents well.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Company lost $139.2 million or $2.51 per share, which includes a $198.5 million of after-tax losses on our investment portfolio. Pre-tax investment losses represents 6% of the portfolio value at December 2019. The majority of those investments are mark-to-market adjustments on securities that continue to be held by the Company.\n\nOur first quarter operating earnings were $1.07 per share, compared to $0.87 per share in the first quarter of 2019. The improvement in operating earnings was primarily due to a reduction in the combined ratio from 97.3% in the first quarter of 2019 to 95.9% in the first quarter of 2020. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were $2 million, compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2019. The Company recorded $15 million in unfavorable reserve development in the quarter, compared to $1 million in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of catastrophe losses and unfavorable reserve development, the combined ratio was 93.8% in the quarter compared to 95.9% in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nOur private passenger auto combined ratio was approximately 93.6% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 96.8% in the first quarter of 2019. The improvement in the prior passenger auto combined ratio was primarily due to higher average premiums from rate increases taken during 2019, less unfavorable reserve development and a reduction in frequency, partially offset by an increase in severity. The Company recorded $3 million of unfavorable reserve development in our private passenger auto line of business in the quarter, compared to $10 million of unfavorable reserve development in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nOur homeowners combined ratio was 101% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 102% in the first quarter of 2019. Our homeowners results were negatively impacted in the quarter by $6 million of unfavorable reserve development compared to $8 million of favorable reserve development in the first quarter of 2019. Homeowners catastrophe losses in the quarter were less than $1 million compared to $3 million in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of reserve development and catastrophe losses, the homeowners combined ratio was 95.3% in the quarter, compared to 100.6% in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nTo improve our homeowners results, a 6.99% rate increase in our California homeowners line went into effect on April 21. This rate increase is on top of a 6.99% California homeowners rate increase implemented in August of 2019. California homeowners premiums earned represent about 87% of Companywide direct homeowners premiums earned and 14% of direct Companywide premiums earned.\n\nOur commercial auto business posted a combined ratio of approximately 100% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 102% in the first quarter of 2019. Those results include approximately $5 million of unfavorable prior-year reserve development in both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. Excluding the impact of reserve development, the combined ratio was 91% in both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe expense ratio was 25.3% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 24.8% in the first quarter of 2019. The higher expense ratio is primarily due to a $7 million increase in the Company's bad debt provision. The increase in the bad debt provision was made in anticipation of a higher number of premium balance write-off, as payment due dates are being extended to customers facing financial difficulties due to COVID-19.\n\nPremiums written grew 4.1% in the quarter, primarily due to higher average premiums per policy and an increase in homeowners policies written. Private passenger auto and homeowners' new business applications are down over 20% and 10%, respectively, as compared to the reach prior to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAs previously announced, we are giving back 15% of monthly auto insurance premiums to personal auto customers for two months, as less driving during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in fewer accidents and claims. Accordingly, we expect second quarter premiums written and earned to be reduced by approximately $70 million [Phonetic], as a result of the giveback. We will continue to monitor the extent and duration of the economic impact related to COVID-19 and make further adjustments as necessary. We expect our underwriting and loss adjustment expense ratios to increase in further -- in future quarters, as premiums declined without a proportionate reduction in expenses. Agent compensation will not be reduced for the premiums we are giving back.\n\nWith that brief background, we will now take questions.\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. My first question would be for you to explain what's the difference is in your 15% of two-month refunds to private passenger customers? What's the difference between that and what the California Insurance Commissioner has ordered? If there is any difference?\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, there -- the California Commissioner did not order any specific type of percentage giveback. He just ordered companies to give back premium, but did not order any type of specific giveback. He did say it was for a certain duration starting in March and April as well and further update any order going forward as he felt necessary.\n\nI don't know, Jeff, do you want to add anything else to that?\n\nJeffrey M. Schroeder -- Vice President and Chief Product Officer\n\nNo, Gabe. You said it correctly. I would just reiterate the point that we have been consistent with the time frame that the commissioner set out.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nGreat. And your -- for your two months, I thought your -- so none of the refunds were effect -- in effect for the March quarter. So I assume you're going to, sort of, retroactively refund for March and then also April in the next two -- next month or two?\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. That's correct. From March 18th, I think it is, to May 17th, will impact the second quarter. And that's approximately $70 million that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nAnd Gabe, did you guys go -- did you -- did you get approval from -- did you notify the Commissioner doing this? Did they sign-off on it? Did they gave you a seal of approval on it?\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe order basically gave -- didn't require any kind of formal approval. His order did not require a formal approval.\n\nHe just ask companies to do it, and there is no formal approval required.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nGreat. And so in your comments you said that the underwriting expense wouldn't -- if the ratio would go up because the underlying expense hadn't changed. I suppose there is some prevailing wins with the loss ratio too, right? Lower accident frequency drives the loss ratio down, but you're getting a lower premium. So is that a net-net push or how's -- what's your view on that?\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell -- We're going to be giving back premium as a result of the lower frequency as you mentioned, and we're going to have to just evaluate going forward what that means with respect to how long this continues and make determinations at that time. So there are some offsetting things going on as you -- for example, severity could be going up for both BI and material damage. It was going up -- before pre-COVID, it was going up, and there is evidence of increasing speeds associated with less congested roads and highways, which leads to more serious accidents. There is potential for cost pressures on parts that's due to potential supply chain issues. So, there is a lot of uncertainties right now, I would say.\n\nOn the top line, our top-line is going to go down. We have the premium giveback. We have a little bit lower new business volume as well. On the loss side, losses are down, but we also have higher bad debt provisions. How this nets out, we're going to have to see in future -- we're basically monitoring it very closely.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thank you for that answer. Actually, it's good color. Can you just update us, I think there was a couple of active rate filings in the pipeline. Have those been sidelined for the time being?\n\nYeah, Greg. Prior to the pandemic that -- we were seeing severity increases in California personal auto, still outpaced frequency declines. And hence, the rate filings that we had here in California, they remain outstanding with the California Department of Insurance. But we don't expect the department to act on our applications during the state of emergency. So you can say that there are on hold right now.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Can we pivot to just the reinsurance structure? Can you talk about your reinsurance structure for the homeowners business for the 2020 calendar year? And how, if at all, it's going to change relative to the structure last year? And I'm thinking about things like in terms of retentions, etc.\n\nYeah, Greg. So just to remind the audience, our current treaty has a $600 million of limit in excess of our $40 million retention, and there are some small flavors that exclude wildfire. But for the most part, wildfire is in there. We're currently in the process or getting into the process for the July 1 renewal. As a reminder, we paid around $38 million for our current coverage. We plan to buy a comparable amount this July 1. We are seeing how the market is, but we plan to buy a comparable amount. As far as rates, right now, I think our anticipation is some maybe modest increases. But we're -- that's our plan. We need to get into the process in meeting with the reinsurers before we can really know exactly where that's all going to shake out.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nGot it. I guess that's going to happen virtually these days. Do you anticipate that your retention, the $40 million retention that you had last year is going to stick through this year or is it possible that could change?\n\nTheodore R. Stalick -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nIt's possible it could change. Right now, our desire is to keep it right around where it was in the current treaty.\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nA lot of that will depend, Greg, on pricing, right. I mean it depends -- it will depend on pricing. So -- but our intention right now is to keep it where it's at, but with the caveat of what the pricing look like at that low level [Phonetic].\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nGreat. My last question just will focus on the investment results. And I realize that a portion of the realized investment gain was just a mark-to-market adjustment. I was hoping that we can get two things. First of all, how reinvestment yields are looking today versus they were before this crisis hit? And then secondly, just to give us some idea within the real -- the realized investment, how much of that is the investment loss? How much of that is just the valuation for this actual sale?\n\nYeah. Hi, Greg. Yeah. So as far as reinvestment levels go, I mean during March, when the height of the crisis unfolded, the levels that you could get, especially on municipal bonds, were just incredible. And we pushed a lot of capital into the market at that point in time. But once the government stepped in and started with all of these different phases of the bailouts, all the markets really normalized quite quickly to a large degree.\n\nWe still see bifurcation on the municipal side. Clearly, there are state or certain sectors of revenue bonds that are under pressure, like an airport bond or hospitals or certain states, Illinois particularly would be under pressure. Those bonds still traded fairly cheaply, but other bonds that have a good support for either sales tax revenues or income tax revenues that are still holding up. Those bonds are still trading at really good spread -- well, very competitive spread. So it's surprising how quickly this market has looked through the current economic problems.\n\nAs far as the mark-to-market levels go, we did take losses in the quarter. I think we amounted to something in the neighborhood of just $10 million. So most of it that you saw because we passed everything through. Most of what you saw is simply mark-to-market losses. Just like back in 2008, 2009 we were on the same methodology. Everything gets pushed through in 2008 with tremendous unrealized losses that we labeled as realized. And then in 2009, the market came back, and all of those unrealized shifts were labeled as realized on the income statement.\n\nGreg Peters -- Raymond James. -- Analyst\n\nThanks for the color. I guess the -- given -- considering the snapback in the market, we will see a reversal of part of that mark-to-market adjustment in the second quarter. Thank you, everyone, for your answers.\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters.\n\nGabriel Tirador -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I'd like to thank, everyone, for joining us this quarter, and we look forward to joining you next quarter.

In addition, and recognizing the difficulties in providing accurate and meaningful forward-looking disclosure, the Corporate Issuer Statement also urged companies to disclose as much material information as is practicable regarding their planning for, and expectations regarding, the company's future financial condition and operating status. The statement also reminded corporate issuers to strive for consistency across their various public and confidential disclosures and to fulfill their legal requirements with respect to the disclosure and dissemination of material non-public information.[4]\n\nFollowing on from the recognition that forward-looking information, generally and particularly in times of broad societal and economic stress, is subject to various assumptions and factors beyond the control of the company, the Corporate Issuer Statement noted that good faith attempts to provide appropriately framed forward-looking information were not expected to be second guessed by the SEC. The Corporate Issuer Statement also highlighted the availability of (and encouraged the use of) safe harbors for forward-looking statements.\n\nWhile there are significant differences between our corporate capital markets and our municipal securities markets, the importance of high quality disclosure, particularly in times of uncertainty, is consistent. Accordingly, we believe a similar approach to the provision of current and, to the extent practicable, forward-looking disclosure would provide significant benefits to investors, issuers and the municipal securities market generally. [5] In order to facilitate the provision of these important municipal securities-related disclosures, and the digestion of those disclosures by investors and other market participants, we offer the following observations and requests.[6]\n\nThe municipal securities market is a large, diverse, important, complex and specialized segment of the U.S. capital markets and our domestic economy more generally. States, cities, local governments and special-purpose entities issue municipal securities to raise long-term funding, and, to a more limited extent, short-term funding. These funding needs support a vast array of important projects that promote the public good such as hospitals, transportation systems, schools and utilities. Providing a capital markets-based funding source for these vital, public-sector needs has long been the role of our municipal securities market. It is generally accepted that the continued functioning of this market is essential to the continued funding and operation of state and local governments and our economy more generally.\n\nThe municipal securities market is dominated by retail investors. At the end of 2019, Main Street investors held directly, and indirectly through funds and other managed products, over 72 percent of the market, or approximately $3 trillion of outstanding municipal securities. This retail focus is driven largely by the favorable federal, state and local tax treatment holders of municipal securities often receive. As a result, investors and accounts that do not benefit from favorable municipal securities tax treatment -- e.g., pension funds and retirement accounts -- generally do not purchase municipal securities.\n\nIn addition to being largely retail investor driven, the municipal securities market differs from other fixed income markets -- e.g., corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries -- in other important respects. The market is remarkably diverse and issuers vary tremendously in size, purpose, and capital needs. There are approximately 50,000 issuers of municipal securities, including states, their political subdivisions (such as cities, towns, counties, and school districts), their agencies and instrumentalities (such as housing, health care, airport, port, and economic development authorities and agencies), as well as a variety of private entities that access the market through \"conduit\" financings (such as hospitals, senior living and continuing care retirement communities, and museums).[7] There are approximately one million different municipal securities outstanding compared to approximately 30,000 corporate bonds outstanding.[8] Offerings of municipal securities range in size from thousands of dollars to billions of dollars, and the payments of principal and interest on these securities come from a variety of sources, including general revenues, specific tax receipts, or revenues from a particular project, among others.\n\nThe municipal securities market also is generally more fragmented than other fixed income markets. Typically characterized as a \"buy and hold\" market, in ordinary market conditions, a significant number of municipal bonds never trade or only trade infrequently after the initial offering period. This generally means that liquidity can vary significantly depending on the issuer, how long the bonds have been outstanding, the size of the series and other idiosyncratic factors. Nevertheless, daily trade volume when measured in dollars and number of trades is significant -- approximately $12.4 billion and 34,467 per day, respectively.[9]\n\nJust as it is diverse, the municipal securities market is also complex. In addition to the traditional general obligation bonds backed by the taxing power and/or \"full faith and credit\" of the issuing entity, municipal issuers employ a variety of complex and issuer-specific credit structures to support their bonds. For example, municipal issuers also issue revenue bonds backed by specific revenues such as sales and use taxes, tax increments, or the revenues of the enterprise being financed -- e.g., a utility system, a toll road or transit system. In a conduit revenue bond financing, the bondholder generally cannot look to the issuer of the bonds, but instead must rely on the revenue stream pledged by the conduit borrower. Adding complexity to these myriad credit structures, municipal issuers also utilize a variety of derivative products as part of their capital financing portfolios and other risk-management strategies. These derivatives generally are designed to reduce risks, but in some cases their performance may be material to an investment decision.\n\nMunicipal issuers and investors in municipal securities should recognize that these factors generally mean that to some meaningful extent both issuer-specific disclosures and security-specific disclosures are material.[10] In addition, we encourage financial professionals to discuss the importance of issuer-specific and security-specific disclosures with the Main Street investors they serve and to consider the extent of such disclosures when providing recommendations and investment advice to Main Street investors.\n\nOver the years, the Commission has encouraged municipal issuers to provide robust, timely and accurate information to investors and market participants.[11] The SEC's focus on this issue has intensified in the past several years as we, together with our colleagues in the Office of Municipal Securities, have frequently called on municipal issuers to provide investors with more timely information, and also generally raised awareness about the importance of investor access to current financial information.[12]\n\nToday, in light of the potentially significant effects of COVID-19 on the finances and operations of many municipal issuers, we increase this focus and request that municipal issuers provide investors with as much information about their current financial and operating condition as is reasonably practicable. The fluid and unpredictable nature of the public health crisis and its financial and economic impacts on municipal issuers has placed investor need for timely financial information into stark relief. We observe that, in today's markets, the typical practice of providing historic financial information in the form of an annual information filing or similar disclosure may not enable investors to make informed assessments of the municipal issuer's current and expected future financial condition.\n\nImportant Considerations that Generally Weigh in Favor of Providing Updated Investor-Oriented Disclosures that Discuss the Current and Anticipated Effects of COVID-19\n\nWe acknowledge that developing voluntary, unaudited, and non-routine disclosures regarding current financial status and operating conditions may be challenging, particularly under the current circumstances. For example, we recognize that such disclosures likely would not have the benefit of a formal audit process or an established framework. We also recognize that, in many cases and even for disclosures regarding current status, certain financial disclosure would be based on estimates and assumptions as well as projections regarding future circumstances. Nevertheless, we believe providing as much current issuer- and security-specific information as is practicable will benefit issuers, investors and our municipal securities markets more generally.\n\nWe also encourage municipal issuers to provide investors with forward-looking information regarding the potential future impact of COVID-19 on their financial and operating conditions. We understand that providing detailed information regarding future operating conditions and resource needs is challenging, particularly as response strategies designed to mitigate and more effectively treat COVID-19 are evolving rapidly and are likely to change in the future.\n\nWe recognize that the issue of liability often is raised when voluntary disclosures -- or the expansion of required disclosures -- are considered. While each issuer, in many cases in consultation with legal counsel, will have to assess this risk in the context of its particular circumstances, we believe there are various factors that generally weigh in favor of making these disclosures.\n\nWe also recognize the issue of timing -- e.g., when to make updating disclosure -- often is raised in these circumstances. For municipal issuers with pending offerings of securities or required filings, we encourage you to include the disclosures discussed above, including for reasons of completeness. We also observe that not all municipal issuers with outstanding securities will conduct new offerings or be required to make a disclosure filing in the coming months. However, for the reasons of consistency and fair dissemination of disclosure discussed above, and because the operational and financial condition of a municipal issuer, particularly under the current circumstances, can change rapidly, we urge these issuers to consider providing voluntary disclosure regarding the current and reasonably anticipated future impacts of COVID-19 on their operational and financial condition.\n\nExamples of Information Municipal Issuers Could Provide to Investors\n\nWhile not intended to be an exclusive list, the following sets forth examples of certain types of disclosures that we believe may be important to provide to investors and the marketplace more generally at this time, whether in a primary offering document, a contractually required continuing disclosure filing,[14] or in a voluntary public statement.[15]\n\nDisclosures should reflect the issuer's assessment of this state of affairs and outlook and, in particular municipal issuers should provide information regarding: (1) their current operational and financial status, including decreases in revenues and delays in collection of revenues; (2) how their COVID-19 response including efforts to protect the health and well-being of residents and employees has impacted their operational and financial condition, including un-budgeted costs; and (3) how their operational and financial condition may change as efforts to fight COVID-19 evolve. In these circumstances, comparisons to historical information may be relatively less significant.\n\nWe welcome engagement on these matters and encourage participants in the municipal securities markets to continue to reach out to us on these and other important issues. We also again encourage financial professionals to discuss these matters with their investors who buy, sell and hold municipal securities, including in particular when providing recommendations and investment advice to Main Street investors.", "dtype": "news", "published_on": "2020-05-04T19:55:00Z", "uri": "6055886468", "url": "https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-importance-of-disclosure-for-our-municipal-markets-sec-chairman-jay-clayton/"}], "6055367999": [924080507, {"pk": 924080507, "name": "It is time for fiscal policy to complement monetary accommodation", "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "text": "In a note on the market outlook, Munot said that the easy global liquidity will not last forever.\n\nThe current recession will ensure unprecedented monetary accommodation over the next several quarters, but monetary policy is reaching its limits in effectively reviving the economy globally and is leading to rising wealth inequality as an unwelcome side effect, he said.\n\n\"To top it all, the current crisis has hit the bottom strata the most.

It seems that the coronavirus popped the Everything Bubble. Where do you see the stock market going?\n\nDavid Stockman: I'd say it's going in a new direction, and it's not up year after year, month after month, day after day.\n\nIt's not going to be a world where buying the dip is a no-brainer thing to do.\n\nI think the stock market was insanely valued when the S&P 500 peaked at 3,380 on February 19th.\n\nYou look at the news flow every day, and it's like a massive political arm-wrestling match between the White House and the Democratic governors and mayors.\n\nI'm sure in their minds, these local and state politicians, think they're serving the public good and protecting the safety and lives of their citizens. But, the fact is, back in the unstated regions of their brains, they're focused on taking down the US economy, which was Trump's only claim to reelection.\n\nI think when push comes to shove in the great human struggle of things in our political system, this lockdown lunacy is going to be prolonged far longer than you can imagine, and the economic loss is going to be staggering.\n\nEven the Wall Street brokers now -- Goldman Sachs and the rest of them -- are projecting a 25 to 30% GDP collapse on an annualized basis in Q2.\n\nJust a few days ago, they were all expecting this to be one and done, and that in the next quarter it'll level out -- but that view is fading very fast.\n\nWe have a hand-to-mouth economy. By that, I mean no business could afford cashflow interruption because they had levered their balance sheet to the hilt or had spent most of their cashflow available to buy back their stock.\n\nSo, once you start these chain reactions, you have incredibly vulnerable business balance sheets in America that collectively have $16 trillion of debt.\n\nI'm not talking about banks or financial institutions now -- just operating businesses.\n\nThat's not to mention American households -- half of them don't even have $300 to last a week or two.\n\nOverwhelmingly, 90% of the households in America have been told that they're the Energizer spending bunny of American economics, and if you don't have enough wages this week, borrow some money on your credit card and just keep on spending.\n\nThis has created a hand-to-mouth economy that has no immunities -- if you want to use that metaphor in an economic sense. It cannot cope, and it has no antibodies to fight back against the interruption of paychecks and cash flow.\n\nThere is going to be broken furniture everywhere as it filters through an economy that is sitting with $74 trillion of public and private debt on its back. That's how much we have today.\n\nPeople need to focus on this fact, that we thought we had a warning back when the great financial crisis occurred in 2008 when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, the Great Recession, all that.\n\nAt the time, there was $52 trillion of debt in the economy, and people said that we're living beyond our means -- we need to learn some lessons here and repair the excesses.\n\nWell, that never happened. We've added $22-23 trillion of debt since then. Therefore, the economy is now even more fragile, even more vulnerable to any kind of dislocation.\n\nNow, what we're getting is the mother of all dislocations. It's happening so fast and severely that it's off the charts.\n\nYou can look at any of the so-called incoming indicators that everybody constantly jaws about on bubble vision on CNBC, and you will see that the last two data points are literally off the charts. The Empire State Index was out recently, and it's down to -70, against a base of zero, and it usually says +20, 30, or 40.\n\nNever has anything like this been recorded. We have an economy that's going to implode in the next four or five months. Earnings are going to drop tremendously.\n\nIt's going to be a question of whether the markets can convince themselves to \"do the Rip Van Winkle thing, go to sleep on earnings for the next year, and start discounting 2022 earnings,\" or something.\n\nI don't think that's going to work this time. I believe there is going to be a real loss of confidence because the Fed has no dry powder.\n\nThe market will likely work its way down in irregular, violent, volatile moves. It will go up for a few days and then experience a big correction, and up for a few more days, another big correction.\n\nThe S&P 500 ought to be valued at 1,500 or 1,600, which is way the hell below where it is today -- and far below where it was at the peak of almost 3,400.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, the market that never stops rising has finally met its match.\n\nThe patented \"buy the dip\" mantra is going to keep the thing alive for a few more months until the last robo-machine and day trader has his brains blown out after they bought the dip one more time and then got monkey-hammered by another reversal.\n\nThat's where I think we're heading.\n\nInternational Man: The Federal Reserve's unprecedented bailout of everyone and everything seems to have no end. What do you think the consequences of this will be?\n\nDavid Stockman: I think what people must get their minds around is that this is happening with such warp speed: job losses, cash flow, GDP, the federal budget.\n\nWhat the Fed has done is more off the charts than anything we've seen yet.\n\nIn early March, the balance sheet of the Fed was at $4.2 trillion -- after they gave up on quantitative tightening (QT) and normalizing the balance sheet -- which they promised to do when Ben Bernanke took it to these high levels after the great recession.\n\nRecently, that number was $6.2 trillion.\n\nIn merely 30 days, they printed $2 trillion of additional balance sheet or doubled the first trillion. That's the level first achieved in September 2008 -- and had taken the Fed 94 years to create from the days that it opened its doors.\n\nI calculated it: that's about 35,000 days it took the Fed to get the first $1 trillion of balance sheet.\n\nThese madmen and women in the Eccles Building, it took them 30 days to create twice the amount of balance sheet that it took during those first 95 years of the Fed.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIt means that they're destroying the financial markets as we know them.\n\nThere's no interest rate left. They're pushing everything close to zero through this massive intervention and buying everything in sight directly or indirectly. That includes commercial paper, municipal bonds, investment-grade corporates, fallen angels, so to speak -- that's just a backdoor way into junk. They're buying ETFs -- the bond ETFs.\n\nIt's only a matter of time before they're going to be in there, hand over fist, buying stocks.\n\nJanet Yellen and all the rest of them are saying, \"Well, maybe they need that additional power.\"\n\nHow can you have capitalism when you have no capital markets?\n\nIt's that simple. The Fed destroyed it.\n\nThe consequence will be massive speculation, malinvestment, and keeping all the zombies alive.\n\nFor instance, the high yield market had a significant dislocation recently -- where yields soared from 5% to 10% or more -- which was an effort by Mr. Market to say that there are a lot of borrowers out there that aren't solvent. They're going to have to meet their maker in Chapter 11.\n\nSo, what is the Fed trying to do?\n\nIt's trying to prevent any of that from happening. The Fed wants to keep everybody that has borrowed up to their eyeballs alive.\n\nTherefore, it means that the economy will become weaker, more stagnant, and more inefficiency-ridden with time.\n\nIf you don't have the cleansing process of creative disruption, if you don't allow the price of capital to reflect risk and reward, if you don't permit failures to be eliminated and liquidated, you're going to have either a sclerotic economy like Italy or England or even worse, a Soviet economy, if you carry this far enough.\n\nFrankly, I think the right phrase for the Eccles Building and the twelve people on the FOMC is the \"Monetary Politburo.\" They're trying to control every movement in the entire economic system through the domination of financial asset prices and pegging of interest rates across the whole yield curve.\n\nIt is madness.\n\nWhere it will lead is very hard to say. Obviously, not to anything good.\n\nIt is so off the charts, and ludicrous relative to anything anybody thought even ten years ago, certainly twenty or thirty years ago. It's difficult to imagine how bad it is going to get, but it's going to get pretty bad.\n\nInternational Man: Those are some great points. Where do you see the future of the US dollar?\n\nDavid Stockman: To paraphrase Winston Churchill about democracy, the US dollar is the worst currency imaginable -- except for all the other currencies in the world.\n\nIn other words, all the central banks are doing the same thing the Fed is doing, only worse. It's a race to the bottom.\n\nThe European Central Bank cut its policy rate to even deeper subzero, which is just crazy.\n\nThe Bank of Japan might as well just buy a paper mill and print paper until there are no trees left in Japan.\n\nIn the case of the US dollar, the traditional idea is that we're going to destroy the currency. That's true if the rest of the world is prudent.\n\nWe don't have a Weimar Republic 1923 situation where they were trying, in the UK and certainly in New York, and the Bank of France, to restore sound money -- prewar money. They failed, but they were attempting to restore sound money and a gold standard currency.\n\nGermany was a basket case economically; they were paying reparations and started up their printing press. There was massive capital outflow, they imported inflation, which then fed upon itself, and the whole wheelbarrow full of money thing happened.\n\nThat was inflation in one country when the rest of the world was trying to pursue relatively sound money.\n\nBy contrast, today, we have monetary inflation in all countries. So you look at the dollar, and you look at what the other central banks are doing, the dollar is the cleanest dirty shirt in the laundry. It's probably going to get stronger, not weaker in the FX markets.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that we're out of the woods.\n\nIt only means that the central banks of the world collectively -- which have already taken their balance sheets from $2 trillion in the late 1990s to over $25 trillion -- are printing money at such a rate that they're likely to bring down the entire world monetary system. Not simply the US dollar.\n\nInternational Man: How will the Fed's actions affect savers and retirees?\n\nDavid Stockman: The essence of it is that the Fed policy is criminal -- just flat out criminal -- in terms of its impact on savers and retirees on a fixed income.\n\nThere is no interest rate left unless you want to speculate in junk bonds. Why should a 78-year-old be speculating in junk bonds to pay for rent or put food on the table?\n\nIt is criminal.\n\nThat's what this whole financial repression, zero interest rate, or subzero interest rate policy is doing. It's hurting tens of millions of people who've tried to save and be prudent and not live hand to mouth.\n\nIf something like COVID-19 comes along, or an earthquake depending on where you live, or just a bad spell of health affecting your family, you need something to fall back on.\n\nHow can people save today when you get nothing?\n\nTake somebody who worked in the steel mill 40 years, who was able to scratch and save and defer gratification. Let's just say he came up with $300,000 of lifetime savings. He's now retired. He needs to keep it liquid, but he's earning less interest income per week than one cappuccino at Starbucks on a lifetime worth of savings.\n\nThat's so evil.\n\nYou may ask these central bankers, \"Well, what about the savers?\" These idiots say that there is too much in savings.\n\nWell, let's look around right now.\n\nWhy do we have a $2.3 trillion bailout? Why are we giving helicopter money to upwards of 180 million people -- who are going to get that $1,200 check?\n\nWhy are we bailing out small businesses left and right to have them preserve jobs?\n\nWhy are we doing all of that if there's an excess of savings in the world?\n\nIn reality, there is no excess. It's complete nonsense.\n\nThe idea that the central bank is there to subsidize, coddle, and bail out the borrower and savage the saver is just fundamentally wrong and goes right to the heart of why we're in such big trouble.", "uri": "6055036749", "url": "https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/05/david-stockman/david-stockman-on-the-destruction-of-the-financial-markets-and-what-it-means-for-you/"}], "6054991413": [518252384, {"sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "published_on": "2020-05-04T03:47:00Z", "name": "QE Defender - Stop The QE Insanity: Helicopter Money And The Risk Of Hyperinflation", "dtype": "news", "pk": 518252384, "text": "In 2016 at FreedomFest in Las Vegas, BullionStar first launched the QE Defender game.\n\nWith the central banks going all in on debasement of money by all means of quantitative easing and money printing, the QE Defender Game is more relevant than ever. We have therefore updated the characters of the game which can be played for free without registration here.\n\n\"There's an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve\" - Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, March 23\n\n\"When it comes to this lending, we're not going to run out of ammunition, that doesn't happen\" - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, March 26\n\nOver the last two months, major central banks and governments across the globe have unleashed a series of monetary and fiscal interventions on markets and economies which are unprecedented in their magnitude and which are bordering on the destruction of the current financial system.\n\nWhile the global spread of coronavirus COVID-19 provided the trigger and the pretext for the current full-spectrum quantitative easing, money printing, asset purchases and economic bailouts, the size and scope of the current assault on free markets makes all previous central bank and government interventions look insignificance in comparison.\n\nMarkets are now officially broken. In some cases, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have become the markets, such is the scale of their asset buying, and their actions are making the bailouts of 2008 and 1998's Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) look like a walk in the park.\n\nFrom quantitative easing to zero bound interest rate cuts and beyond, from helicopter money to economy wide bailouts, the combined monetary and fiscal interference in markets and economies over recent weeks has now distorted everything from market prices to risk preferences to the time value of money, while shattering the concept of freely trading markets and free enterprise.\n\nAll of this in an environment of locked down economies, minimal economic activity, huge job losses, shrinking tax revenue and economic stagnation, as well as the impending approach of an unprecedented global recession, that if long lasting, will become a depression.\n\nOn the monetary side, the renewed and limitless quantitative easing - with central banks creating money out of thin air to buy up financial assets across all risk categories - combined with interest rate distortions, is both prolonging the very asset bubbles that the same central banks themselves created, while also leading to explosive increases in money supply. This in turn is leading to the destruction of currency values, and most worryingly, setting the scene for the real possibility of hyperinflation.\n\nOn the fiscal side, government stimulus packages of direct payments and loan and tax write-offs across vast swathes of economic sectors is not only creating a future dependence on income support and a pretext for the introduction of direct transfers to individuals, but is burdening the very same workforces with future tax burdens and even more debt.\n\nHelicopter Drops\n\nIn this scenario, helicopter money, analogous to a helicopter dropping cash directly to the population, comes into play. Essentially helicopter cash represents direct methods of boosting consumer demand by the distribution of currency directly to the public into their bank accounts and into their pockets. Like quantitative easing, direct cash drops pave the way for destruction of currencies and can be the touch-paper to trigger hyperinflation.\n\nImportantly, on both the monetary and fiscal fronts, the sheer flood of official interventions across markets and economies is now creating the largest moral hazard problem the world has ever seen, with investors and economic actors being conditioned to the expectation that central banks and governments will always come to the rescue by propping up asset prices and bailing out entire sectors (think banks, airlines and real estate), thus creating an environment that encourages a lack of individual consequences for future risky behavior, but at the same time creating dire consequences for the collective financial and economic system.\n\nWhile the scale of what is happening right is daunting and difficult to keep track of, a ballpark estimate suggests that the total size of interventions from just some of the world's largest monetary and fiscal authorities is currently more than US $10 trillion and counting. For a taste for how uncharted and dangerous this QE is becoming, a quick look at the US and Europe is instructive.\n\nQuantifying QE - USA: Whatever it takes\n\nAfter cutting interest rates to zero via two emergency decisions during March (March 3 here and March 15 here), the US Federal Reserve then announced on 15 March that over the coming months it would ramp up QE by buying at least $500 billion of US Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThat's $700 billion of Fed debt buying from banks and the Treasury across a cross section of widening of risk categories. At the same time, the Fed begun flooding the Fed system with credit in an attempt to boost liquidity, including $1 trillion in repurchase operations per day.\n\nWhen this didn't placate markets, the Fed then went 'all in' on 23 March and announced the start of open-ended quantitative easing (QE) in unlimited amounts, to buy an even wider range of debt from low to much higher risk classes, promising to:\n\n\"purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed...including purchases of corporate and municipal bonds.\"\n\nThe Fed then also established swap lines with a whole range of major central banks around the world, providing these central banks with dollar funding in exchange for US Treasuries. This in essence expands the money supply of US dollars all over the world.\n\nThen on 9 April the Fed was back, announcing another $2.3 trillion in QE, in the form of $600 billion purchases of bank loans of individuals and businesses, $500 billion buying of municipal bonds and loans (states, cities etc), and $850 billion in QE related to credit facilities of US corporates and asset-backed vehicles. Incredibly, this includes junk bonds and junk bond ETFs, with such market euphemisms as high yield, extended yield, and beyond investment grade. There is therefore, it seems, no limit to the depths the US Fed will go in its quest to prop up prices, bail out Wall St banks and hedge funds, and destroy financial markets.\n\nNot surprisingly, this new unprecedented and unlimited QE by the Fed over March and April can already be seen in the huge explosion in US money supply, where the monetary aggregate measure M2 (which includes cash, demand deposits, time deposits and money market mutual funds) has rocketed higher from the new money \"out of thin air\" that has no bearing on underlying economic growth. This can be seen in the below Federal Reserve chart. As a closely watched indicator in forecasting future inflation, this M2 chart speaks volumes.\n\nIn the same vein, as architect of this rampant QE, the money out of thin air hits the Fed's bottom line,showing up in the rapid expansion of the Fed's balance sheet, which has ballooned from $ 4.17 trillion at the end of February to $6.4 trillion now. That's an insane $2.2 trillion added since the start of March, or in other words, a 50% expansion in the Fed's balance sheet since the end of February. This is neatly illustrated in the blow out of the Fed's total assets since early March.\n\nTurning to US fiscal interventions, at the end of March the US federal government pushed through a staggering $2.2 trillion economic bailout package titled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), an intervention so large that it's equivalent to 10% of US GDP. This CARES Act (which was ready and waiting in the wings) covers everything from loans to large and small corporations ($750 billion), the bailout of the US airline industry ($26 billion), loans to states and local governments ($340 billion), and most controversially, direct payments to individuals ($300 billion).\n\nThis last category is literally 'helicopter money', with every taxpayer in the US set to receive a $1200 payment, plus an additional $500 per child, with the transfers being made via stimulus checks (cheques) and direct deposits to bank accounts. The US IRS calls these Economic Impact Payments, but they are really direct cash injections, literally the long predicted helicopter cash drops. This money is printed out of thin air, directly distributed to the population, and most importantly raises the money supply while diluting the purchasing power of all existing currency.\n\nAn image from the original version of BullionStar's \"QE Defender' video game launched in 2016 and featuring the Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen\n\nAfter cutting one of its key refinancing rates to -0.75% in early March, the European Central Bank (ECB) then announced new monetary QE interventions on 12 March in the form of \u20ac120 billion of bond buying (quantitative easing) to complement its existing bond buying programme. On the same day, the ECB also announced an intent to flood cheap liquidity to European banks using longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs).\n\nA week later on 18 March, the ECB ramped up the QE and went practically unlimited, announcing an enormous \u20ac750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), a fancy name for even more QE that aims to buy government and corporate bonds (debt), including non-financial commercial paper (short-term loans). In total, that's \u20ac870 billion in monetary QE interventions from the ECB.\n\nExtraordinary times require extraordinary action. There are no limits to our commitment to the euro. We are determined to use the full potential of our tools, within our mandate. https://t.co/RhxuVYPeVR\n\n-- Christine Lagarde (@Lagarde) March 18, 2020\n\nOn the fiscal side, Europe is leading the way with the largest fiscal bailout by any economic bloc so far, totaling a massive \u20ac3.2 trillion in fiscal bailouts across the continent. This includes emergency packages of individual European countries such as Germany, Spain and France, but also an EU wide bailout fund of \u20ac540 billion to which the European Union has agreed, consisting of \u20ac240 billion in credit for Eurozone countries via the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), \u20ac200 billion in loans for small businesses via the European Investment bank, and \u20ac100 billion in loans for job support.\n\nThe sheer scale and unprecedented nature of these European union interventions motivated one of its countless bodies, the European Economic and Social Committee, to proudly comment on 16 April that:\n\n\"In less than 4 weeks, the EU has done more than in the four years following the 2008 crisis, with interventions already decided that are estimated at over EUR 3 trillions.\"\n\nAs to how the EU will pay for all of these bailouts, the EU Commission claims to have the answer, saying that it will, surprise, surprise, \"propose borrowing to finance the recovery plan\".\n\nWith the US government introducing helicopter money, can Europe be far behind? While the European Central Bank claims that helicopter money is not an option that's being considered, would you believe them? In a recent letter responding to a member of the European Parliament (dated 21 April), the ECB's Christine Lagarde avoids the question of whether helicopter money is a fiscal or monetary in nature, only saying that it has never been discussed by the ECB's Governing Council. But in the infamous words of another fellow Europhile Jean-Claude Juncker, \"When it becomes serious you have to lie.\"\n\nBeyond the Fed and the ECB, all other major monetary authorities and governments around the globe are also engaging in massive QE and economic bailouts, from the Bank of Japan and Bank of England to the Chinese and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), from Australia to Brazil and from South Korea to Singapore. For example, the Bank of England has its own \u00a3645 billion QE programme buying UK government bonds and sterling corporate bonds, and has now moved to directly finance the spending the UK Treasury, a form of helicopter money.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Japan has just announced that it will now consider unlimited bond buying of government and corporate bonds - \"Bank of Japan mulling unlimited bond buying at next meeting: Nikkei\". Everywhere one looks, the evidence is there, it's QE to infinity, buying up all debt of all types and all risk categories at any price, in the process destroying the financial system and setting the scene for hyperinflation.\n\nIn an interview in 2010, then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke tried to dissuade concerns over Fed money printing, QE and market interventions, saying that:\n\n\"This fear of inflation I think is way overstated ...What we're doing is lowering interest rates by buying Treasury securities. And by lowering interest rates, we hope to stimulate the economy to grow faster.\n\nThe trick is to find the appropriate moment when to begin to unwind this policy. And that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nFake words then from Bernanke, fake words now. There was no real unwind. Tapering was trick and a distraction. This is the same Bernanke who explained how the Fed's lending is merely electronic printing, creating money out of thin air, and in so doing, inflating the money supply.\n\nFed's Ben Bernanke in 2009: \"To lend to a bank we simply use the computer to mark up the size of the account\" https://t.co/pFLm5FxqM6 #QE\n\n-- BullionStar (@BullionStar) April 23, 2020\n\nQuantitative easing, despite the complicated name, is a simple case of massively expanding the money supply. Helicopter money ditto, is also a simple case of massively expanding the money supply.\n\nBy artificially boosting demand in a scenario of lower production and constrained supply using the printing press and its electronic equivalent (QE and helicopter money), more fiat currency is entering the existing system. This can lead to product shortages, hoarding, and higher consumer prices, i.e. rising inflation, which is the economic textbook situation of too much money chasing too few goods.\n\nRising inflation in turn leads to lower purchasing poor and eroding value for a paper currency, loss of confidence in that currency, and in a downward spiral, faster spending to get rid of the increasingly worthless currency, which in turn leads to even higher prices, hoarding and inflation. And all this in an environment of economic stagnation and recession. This then leads to higher inflation expectations, and ultimately hyperinflation.\n\nAnd what are we seeing right now in the global economy, led by the large central banks and the largest economies? Explosions in money supply brought on by quantitative easing. Increasing experiments of directly transferred helicopter money to artificially boost consumer demand. Supply side shortages and hoarding. Economic turmoil and economies in stagnation due to covid-19 lock downs with massive unemployment and economies slipping into recession and possible depression.\n\nHyperinflation is essentially a rapid and accelerating inflation amid a collapsing currency value, and it can arrive rapidly in an environment where frequent price rises have already begun to take hold. In such scenarios, national cash becomes worthless and precious metals and reserve currencies become stores of values. For some of the more prominent hyperinflationary events in recent times just look at the hyper inflationary experiences of Argentina, Zimbabwe and Venezuela. See \"The Power of Gold in Times of Crisis\" for details.\n\nFor example, in 1989, prices in Argentina rose by an annualized 500 percent. In 2008, Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate at one point reached 231 million percent. Annual inflation in Venezuela, which is still in the midst of hyperinflation, is currently over 2300%.\n\nBut what if hyperinflation hits major economics such as the US and Europe and their 'strong' fiat currencies in the form of the US dollar and Euro? In the current environment of full-scale quantitative easing and the emerging popularity of helicopter money, this is something which populations may soon be about to find out.\n\nUnder this possible scenario, physical gold will become one of the few trusted assets to remain a secure store of value and wealth preservation when paper currencies crash and burn. Universally trusted as a safe harbor in times of crisis and emergency, physical gold is both the proven last man standing and the go to asset in a world at risk of hyperinflation.", "uri": "6054991413", "url": "http://hitrust.net/54415/qe-defender-stop-the-qe-insanity-helicopter-money-and-the-risk-of-hyperinflation/"}], "6054949919": [646643188, {"sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "published_on": "2020-05-04T02:34:00Z", "name": "QE Defender - Stop The QE Insanity: Helicopter Money And The Risk Of Hyperinflation", "dtype": "news", "pk": 646643188, "text": "In 2016 at FreedomFest in Las Vegas, BullionStar first launched the QE Defender game.\n\nWith the central banks going all in on debasement of money by all means of quantitative easing and money printing, the QE Defender Game is more relevant than ever. We have therefore updated the characters of the game which can be played for free without registration here.\n\n\"There's an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve\" - Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, March 23\n\n\"When it comes to this lending, we're not going to run out of ammunition, that doesn't happen\" - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, March 26\n\nOver the last two months, major central banks and governments across the globe have unleashed a series of monetary and fiscal interventions on markets and economies which are unprecedented in their magnitude and which are bordering on the destruction of the current financial system.\n\nWhile the global spread of coronavirus COVID-19 provided the trigger and the pretext for the current full-spectrum quantitative easing, money printing, asset purchases and economic bailouts, the size and scope of the current assault on free markets makes all previous central bank and government interventions look insignificance in comparison.\n\nMarkets are now officially broken. In some cases, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have become the markets, such is the scale of their asset buying, and their actions are making the bailouts of 2008 and 1998's Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) look like a walk in the park.\n\nFrom quantitative easing to zero bound interest rate cuts and beyond, from helicopter money to economy wide bailouts, the combined monetary and fiscal interference in markets and economies over recent weeks has now distorted everything from market prices to risk preferences to the time value of money, while shattering the concept of freely trading markets and free enterprise.\n\nAll of this in an environment of locked down economies, minimal economic activity, huge job losses, shrinking tax revenue and economic stagnation, as well as the impending approach of an unprecedented global recession, that if long lasting, will become a depression.\n\nOn the monetary side, the renewed and limitless quantitative easing - with central banks creating money out of thin air to buy up financial assets across all risk categories - combined with interest rate distortions, is both prolonging the very asset bubbles that the same central banks themselves created, while also leading to explosive increases in money supply. This in turn is leading to the destruction of currency values, and most worryingly, setting the scene for the real possibility of hyperinflation.\n\nOn the fiscal side, government stimulus packages of direct payments and loan and tax write-offs across vast swathes of economic sectors is not only creating a future dependence on income support and a pretext for the introduction of direct transfers to individuals, but is burdening the very same workforces with future tax burdens and even more debt.\n\nHelicopter Drops\n\nIn this scenario, helicopter money, analogous to a helicopter dropping cash directly to the population, comes into play. Essentially helicopter cash represents direct methods of boosting consumer demand by the distribution of currency directly to the public into their bank accounts and into their pockets. Like quantitative easing, direct cash drops pave the way for destruction of currencies and can be the touch-paper to trigger hyperinflation.\n\nImportantly, on both the monetary and fiscal fronts, the sheer flood of official interventions across markets and economies is now creating the largest moral hazard problem the world has ever seen, with investors and economic actors being conditioned to the expectation that central banks and governments will always come to the rescue by propping up asset prices and bailing out entire sectors (think banks, airlines and real estate), thus creating an environment that encourages a lack of individual consequences for future risky behavior, but at the same time creating dire consequences for the collective financial and economic system.\n\nWhile the scale of what is happening right is daunting and difficult to keep track of, a ballpark estimate suggests that the total size of interventions from just some of the world's largest monetary and fiscal authorities is currently more than US $10 trillion and counting. For a taste for how uncharted and dangerous this QE is becoming, a quick look at the US and Europe is instructive.\n\nQuantifying QE - USA: Whatever it takes\n\nAfter cutting interest rates to zero via two emergency decisions during March (March 3 here and March 15 here), the US Federal Reserve then announced on 15 March that over the coming months it would ramp up QE by buying at least $500 billion of US Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThat's $700 billion of Fed debt buying from banks and the Treasury across a cross section of widening of risk categories. At the same time, the Fed begun flooding the Fed system with credit in an attempt to boost liquidity, including $1 trillion in repurchase operations per day.\n\nWhen this didn't placate markets, the Fed then went 'all in' on 23 March and announced the start of open-ended quantitative easing (QE) in unlimited amounts, to buy an even wider range of debt from low to much higher risk classes, promising to:\n\n\"purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed...including purchases of corporate and municipal bonds.\"\n\nThe Fed then also established swap lines with a whole range of major central banks around the world, providing these central banks with dollar funding in exchange for US Treasuries. This in essence expands the money supply of US dollars all over the world.\n\nThen on 9 April the Fed was back, announcing another $2.3 trillion in QE, in the form of $600 billion purchases of bank loans of individuals and businesses, $500 billion buying of municipal bonds and loans (states, cities etc), and $850 billion in QE related to credit facilities of US corporates and asset-backed vehicles. Incredibly, this includes junk bonds and junk bond ETFs, with such market euphemisms as high yield, extended yield, and beyond investment grade. There is therefore, it seems, no limit to the depths the US Fed will go in its quest to prop up prices, bail out Wall St banks and hedge funds, and destroy financial markets.\n\nNot surprisingly, this new unprecedented and unlimited QE by the Fed over March and April can already be seen in the huge explosion in US money supply, where the monetary aggregate measure M2 (which includes cash, demand deposits, time deposits and money market mutual funds) has rocketed higher from the new money \"out of thin air\" that has no bearing on underlying economic growth. This can be seen in the below Federal Reserve chart. As a closely watched indicator in forecasting future inflation, this M2 chart speaks volumes.\n\nIn the same vein, as architect of this rampant QE, the money out of thin air hits the Fed's bottom line,showing up in the rapid expansion of the Fed's balance sheet, which has ballooned from $ 4.17 trillion at the end of February to $6.4 trillion now. That's an insane $2.2 trillion added since the start of March, or in other words, a 50% expansion in the Fed's balance sheet since the end of February. This is neatly illustrated in the blow out of the Fed's total assets since early March.\n\nTurning to US fiscal interventions, at the end of March the US federal government pushed through a staggering $2.2 trillion economic bailout package titled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), an intervention so large that it's equivalent to 10% of US GDP. This CARES Act (which was ready and waiting in the wings) covers everything from loans to large and small corporations ($750 billion), the bailout of the US airline industry ($26 billion), loans to states and local governments ($340 billion), and most controversially, direct payments to individuals ($300 billion).\n\nThis last category is literally 'helicopter money', with every taxpayer in the US set to receive a $1200 payment, plus an additional $500 per child, with the transfers being made via stimulus checks (cheques) and direct deposits to bank accounts. The US IRS calls these Economic Impact Payments, but they are really direct cash injections, literally the long predicted helicopter cash drops. This money is printed out of thin air, directly distributed to the population, and most importantly raises the money supply while diluting the purchasing power of all existing currency.\n\nAn image from the original version of BullionStar's \"QE Defender' video game launched in 2016 and featuring the Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen\n\nAfter cutting one of its key refinancing rates to -0.75% in early March, the European Central Bank (ECB) then announced new monetary QE interventions on 12 March in the form of \u20ac120 billion of bond buying (quantitative easing) to complement its existing bond buying programme. On the same day, the ECB also announced an intent to flood cheap liquidity to European banks using longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs).\n\nA week later on 18 March, the ECB ramped up the QE and went practically unlimited, announcing an enormous \u20ac750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), a fancy name for even more QE that aims to buy government and corporate bonds (debt), including non-financial commercial paper (short-term loans). In total, that's \u20ac870 billion in monetary QE interventions from the ECB.\n\nOn the fiscal side, Europe is leading the way with the largest fiscal bailout by any economic bloc so far, totaling a massive \u20ac3.2 trillion in fiscal bailouts across the continent. This includes emergency packages of individual European countries such as Germany, Spain and France, but also an EU wide bailout fund of \u20ac540 billion to which the European Union has agreed, consisting of \u20ac240 billion in credit for Eurozone countries via the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), \u20ac200 billion in loans for small businesses via the European Investment bank, and \u20ac100 billion in loans for job support.\n\nThe sheer scale and unprecedented nature of these European union interventions motivated one of its countless bodies, the European Economic and Social Committee, to proudly comment on 16 April that:\n\n\"In less than 4 weeks, the EU has done more than in the four years following the 2008 crisis, with interventions already decided that are estimated at over EUR 3 trillions.\"\n\nAs to how the EU will pay for all of these bailouts, the EU Commission claims to have the answer, saying that it will, surprise, surprise, \"propose borrowing to finance the recovery plan\".\n\nWith the US government introducing helicopter money, can Europe be far behind? While the European Central Bank claims that helicopter money is not an option that's being considered, would you believe them?

Explosions in money supply brought on by quantitative easing. Increasing experiments of directly transferred helicopter money to artificially boost consumer demand. Supply side shortages and hoarding. Economic turmoil and economies in stagnation due to covid-19 lock downs with massive unemployment and economies slipping into recession and possible depression.\n\nHyperinflation is essentially a rapid and accelerating inflation amid a collapsing currency value, and it can arrive rapidly in an environment where frequent price rises have already begun to take hold. In such scenarios, national cash becomes worthless and precious metals and reserve currencies become stores of values. For some of the more prominent hyperinflationary events in recent times just look at the hyper inflationary experiences of Argentina, Zimbabwe and Venezuela. See \"The Power of Gold in Times of Crisis\" for details.\n\nFor example, in 1989, prices in Argentina rose by an annualized 500 percent. In 2008, Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate at one point reached 231 million percent. Annual inflation in Venezuela, which is still in the midst of hyperinflation, is currently over 2300%.\n\nBut what if hyperinflation hits major economics such as the US and Europe and their 'strong' fiat currencies in the form of the US dollar and Euro? In the current environment of full-scale quantitative easing and the emerging popularity of helicopter money, this is something which populations may soon be about to find out.\n\nUnder this possible scenario, physical gold will become one of the few trusted assets to remain a secure store of value and wealth preservation when paper currencies crash and burn. Universally trusted as a safe harbor in times of crisis and emergency, physical gold is both the proven last man standing and the go to asset in a world at risk of hyperinflation.", "uri": "6054919330", "url": "https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/qe-defender-stop-qe-insanity-helicopter-money-and-risk-hyperinflation"}], "6054893773": [947204545, {"sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "published_on": "2020-05-04T01:09:00Z", "name": "'We all want to avoid a false start,' Fed Chair Powell says on reopening the economy", "dtype": "news", "pk": 947204545, "text": "\"This is going to be, and is, a very difficult time for many, many people. The Fed's role is to provide stability and relief during this period when the economy is shut down,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, pictured in Washington on March 3, 2020, said of the central bank's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Eric Baradat / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution about reopening the economy too soon, saying \"we all want to avoid a false start\" in a speech Thursday morning just hours after the central bank announced a new multitrillion-dollar round of emergency measures.\n\n\"This is going to be, and is, a very difficult time for many, many people,\" he said in remarks delivered online, under the auspices of the Brookings Institution.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Labor announced another surge in first-time filings for unemployment benefits. Over the last three weeks, more than 16 million Americans have applied for help.\n\nThe Fed's new, $2.3 trillion relief package includes an emergency lending program and plans to buy more assets, such as municipal bonds.\n\n\"We are looking for places that are very important to the real economy,\" Powell said. \"Places that really affect people's lives.\"\n\nAfter an emergency meeting in early March, when the Fed decided to lower rates to near-zero and expand its bond-buying program, there was concern among investors the Fed had few tools remaining in its toolbox. In recent weeks, Fed policymakers have proven them wrong.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers are debating the need for more fiscal support. In his remarks, Powell said further support is \"likely to be appropriate,\" noting the Fed is not responsible for setting fiscal policy.\n\n\"As a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good,\" Powell said, stressing that while the Fed can provide loans, it is not in a position to give grants.\n\n\"The Fed can only make secured loans to solid entities with the expectation that the loans will be fully repaid,\" he said. \"Some entities will need direct fiscal support.\"\n\nThis week, two past Fed chairs have lent their support to its current policymaking. Former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen spoke to lawmakers, and she gave an interview to CNBC. Ben Bernanke also delivered an address at the Brookings Institution.\n\nIn his comments, Bernanke said fiscal legislation shouldn't be seen as a stimulus, saying, \"This is more like a natural disaster, and the response is more like emergency relief than it is a typical stimulus or an anti-recessionary response.\"\n\nAs Americans continue to stay home, and businesses remains shuttered, economists and policymakers have begun to discuss what a return to normal would look like, and when it could happen.\n\n\"That is not a judgment that is assigned to the Fed to make,\" Powell said. \"The Fed's role is to provide stability and relief during this period when the economy is shut down.\"\n\nThis week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance on how companies should prepare for front-line workers to return to work.\n\n\"I do think that it is time to have a serious public conversation and a lot of analysis about that,\" Powell said. \"We need to have a plan nationally for reopening the economy. We all want it to happen as fast as possible. We all want to avoid a false start.\"\n\nAsked for his forecast for the labor market on the heels of the new jobless data, Powell noted Fed economists have had to study and wrestle with science and public health data. \"These are not typical economic questions that our great economists are practiced and skilled at answering,\" he said.\n\nDuring his comments, the Fed chair emphasized that this is, first and foremost, a public health crisis. Powell said his \"expectation is that the second quarter will be a very weak one,\" and he is not worried about inflation.\n\nBernanke, who devoted his academic career to studying the Great Depression, rejected analogies to that economic crisis in his comments. Like Powell, he is optimistic about the economy's prospects -- provided that policymakers pay attention to public health experts.\n\n\"I think the U.S. economy will recover, and will, within a few years, only show modest marks of this experience, he said. \"I think that if we are patient and do what we know we should be doing, we will come out OK on the other end.\"", "uri": "6054893773", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/we-all-want-avoid-false-start-says-fed-chair-powell-n1179881"}], "6054634012": [670748805, {"sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "published_on": "2020-05-03T16:23:00Z", "name": "'It is time for fiscal policy to complement monetary accommodation'", "dtype": "news", "pk": 670748805, "text": "New Delhi, May 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) As the coronavirus pandemic has brought the global economy to a standstill, governments across the world, including India, should come up with massive fiscal stimuli, according to Navneet Munot, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at SBI Funds Management Private Ltd.\n\nIn a note on the market outlook, Munot said that the easy global liquidity will not last forever.\n\nThe current recession will ensure unprecedented monetary accommodation over the next several quarters, but monetary policy is reaching its limits in effectively reviving the economy globally and is leading to rising wealth inequality as an unwelcome side effect, he said.\n\n\"To top it all, the current crisis has hit the bottom strata the most. The stage therefore is set for massive fiscal stimuli globally to complement the monetary effort,\" he said in the note. It could set the stage for an end of the 40-year-old bull market in bonds, he said.\n\n\"When inflation perks up and global rates begin to rise in years to come, capital may not stay as abundant and become much more discerning. We are a country deficient in risk capital and must therefore act quickly and decisively.\"\n\nThe statement further said that while the government is addressing the first order impact on the poor, a lot more needs to be done to help businesses and avoid second order impacts and social agenda needs resources that can only be generated by reviving growth and expanding the pie.\n\nCompared to most countries, he observed that India has been high on stringency of the lockdown and low on fiscal support.\n\n\"While our fiscal room may be limited, we must be cautious of the 'paradox of thrift'. Given the environment, both corporate sector and households may remain thrifty and risk-averse, the onus is on government to lever up and spend,\" said the statement.\n\nWith tax collections expected to fall, non-tax sources will have to be explored ranging from asset monetisation to perhaps government backed municipal bonds -- 'Pandemic bonds' just like 'War bond'.\n\nMunot said that while direct support to poor was critical during the lockdown, as the economy opens fiscal multiplier should be the driving force in prioritising expenditure. Infrastructure projects such as rural roads, urban infrastructure, slum redevelopment, and the likes should be prioritised to create immediate employment and support consumption as well as build productive assets.\n\n\"Fortunately, rural economy is in decent shape and must be shielded from supply chain disruptions as well as from the virus that returning migrant workers may bring along,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the Reserve Bank of India on its part has been aggressive in policy response so far and is doing an even better job at communicating that it stands ready to do whatever it takes to revive the economy.\n\nHowever, Munot said that it has only met with partial success in achieving the desired outcomes and the big disconnect between macro and micro level liquidity stays.\n\n\"The yield curve has continued to steepen, and corporate spreads stay elevated. Muted growth and high nominal rates can lead to debt ratios spiraling out of control. The tepid response to TLTRO 2.0 suggests lack of risk appetite and therefore the real economy stays starved for funds,a he said.\n\nGovernment providing first loss guarantee, further relaxation in prudential norms, and RBI capping absorption through the reverse repo window along with aggressive OMOs are some measures that should help transmission, he added.", "uri": "6054634012", "url": "https://www.socialnews.xyz/2020/05/03/it-is-time-for-fiscal-policy-to-complement-monetary-accommodation/"}], "6054633253": [909033715, {"sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "published_on": "2020-05-03T16:22:00Z", "name": "How COVID-19 May Affect Bond ETF/Fund Performance", "dtype": "news", "pk": 909033715, "text": "Each of the most common type of bond funds are discussed, along with the possible performance implications of the crisis and its after effects .\n\nThe coronavirus has thrown the ordinary world out of whack. So it is no surprise that it has seriously impacted investors. But apart from the already visible effects to investors, the most striking changes, although still uncertain, may be yet to come. So what can an investor do, if anything, to prepare?\n\nThe stock market has been acting like a yo-yo, almost enough to drive one crazy. Some current investors might conclude they should sell, or at least lighten up, while more aggressive types are perhaps licking their chops at what they consider great buying opportunities. Of course, it all likely depends primarily on your goals as an investor: For avoiding worry and possibly sleeping better at night, you might want to sell some stock; for planning on perhaps making an easy profit on funds that haven't been this low in years, you might want to buy some.\n\nBut these drivers of such actions probably reflect more of a narrow, short-term perspective. Over the longer-term, if you can maintain the same patient outlook you might have had prior to the crisis, you may not be impelled to do anything right now. Thus, waiting for stocks to return their more normal ways, that is variable but not heart-poundingly so, as they inevitably will, is probably the best course of action for most.\n\nWould the same relatively unchanged strategy apply when considering bond fund investments? Here things may suggest a somewhat more modified approach.\n\nFor many bond investors, bonds can serve as a ballast to your stock investments. According to the dictionary, a ballast is something that helps you to succeed, especially by keeping the overall circumstance under control.\n\nInvestors in bonds hardly ever would expect a bond fund or ETF to greatly grow their overall wealth. Rather, by providing a more stable counterbalance to one's stock portfolio, one is less likely to experience their entire portfolio falling in unison, thus helping investors to maintain the stock portion of their portfolio until more normal conditions return.\n\nOf course, many investors choose bond funds for an entirely different reason. Bond funds can provide a measure of extra or necessary income, generating regular monthly payments in the form of dividends. While some bond funds can still boast somewhat hefty payouts, with interest rates currently so low now, these dividends have been reduced far below what they may have paid in the past.\n\nBut it should be noted that investing in bonds, especially in some types of funds, is not without significant risk. If the type of bonds in the fund's portfolio is out of favor, the fund can lose value and therefore if you need to sell shares, you may in effect be cancelling out much or all of your accumulated dividends. While you may still receive your dividends, diminished net asset value, or NAV, may cause your overall investment to be worth less today then when you purchased it.\n\nWhether your goal is to use bonds as a ballast or to earn extra income, you should consider carefully which bond fund(s) you choose in order to achieve your goals. And as external circumstances change as they have recently as a result of the coronavirus, you may want to reduce ownership of certain types of bond funds while increasing ownership of others.\n\nBut before I consider which types of bond funds you may want to currently emphasize in a portfolio in light of the potential future impact of the virus, let's take a look at the overall investment environment of which bonds are a part.\n\nAt first, this may seem hard to understand, but a fund's total return is not just determined by yield, but also by investor demand. In spite of low yields, investors have been pouring money into bond funds for their perceived safety as compared to stocks. As demand for an asset increases, so does the NAV of most bond mutual funds. Also, in response to the crisis, extremely aggressive Federal Reserve bond purchases are responsible for driving up the price of bonds, although driving down the yield. So it is still possible for bonds, unlike money market funds, to excel in a low interest environment in spite of the low yields.\n\nThe following are the main types of bond funds/ETFs that investors might want to consider and my appraisal of current prospects for each. Since bond fund category performance, like that of stock categories, can be full of surprises, you should consider these appraisals merely as my opinions since nobody can know for sure what such category performances will be in advance. For example, who would have predicted a year ago that long-term treasury bonds would have returned upwards of 40% over the last 12 months in spite of extremely low interest rates over the period?\n\nNote: Many bond funds consist of a variety of different types of bonds. But most are predominantly one type or another; check at the fund's website if you are unsure.\n\nShort-Term Government\n\nShort-term government funds are probably the least likely to generate losses, regardless of the investment environment. However, they also tend to have the lowest dividends, investing predominantly in US treasury holdings. These bonds will fill the bill for the most conservative of investors. In the unlikely event that interest rates rise quickly, they, unlike most other categories, may only suffer small loses, considerably less than the remaining categories.\n\nAppraisal: Over prior years, short-term government bond funds have tended to go somewhat in the opposite direction as the US stock market. So if you are worried about stocks, these may be the way to go. However, rates are so low that there is only limited appeal to this category.\n\nIntermediate-Term Government\n\nThese funds typically have a slightly higher dividend yield than short-term government funds. They include not only treasury bonds but GNMA (mortgage) bonds. Over the years, these funds have performed a little better than short-term bonds.\n\nAppraisal: Probably the best prospects among government bond funds, combining higher yields with possible NAV appreciation.\n\nLong-Term Government\n\nThese funds have been far and away the best bond fund performers over the last 10 years or more (also recently - see above), even approaching the returns of US stock funds. However, with interest rates already so low, there is a big risk that if and when rates rise, even by just a percent or two, they will suffer poor total returns in spite of paying higher dividends than the above two categories.\n\nAppraisal: Since interest rates are unlikely to rise for perhaps at least a year or two, losses on a total return basis may not be be a big immediate threat. However, owning a long-term treasury bond fund in most cases, especially now, should be undertaken mainly by highly aggressive investors with more of a short-term profit orientation.\n\nCorporate\n\nHigh quality corporate bonds (also called investment grade bonds) typically pay a higher dividend than similar length maturity government bond funds. For example, the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond Index Admiral fund (VSCSX) currently pays 2.45% while the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Index Admiral Fund (VSBSX) only pays a meager 0.19%. However, corporate bond funds are considered somewhat more risky than government bond funds because corporation bond performance may be negatively affected by a deterioration of the economy.\n\nAppraisal: Longer-term corporate bonds have been performing better than shorter-term corporate funds during the long-term decline in interest rates, but as with government bond funds, the longer-term bond will likely suffer more once interest rates eventually rise which is highly probable once the coronavirus crisis subsides.\n\nHigh Yield Bonds\n\nThese are also corporate bonds, but of lower quality than the above category. They are sometimes referred to as \"junk\" bonds. Why? In this case, the quality is determined by rating agencies based on the financial strength of the issuing company. Lower quality bonds are considered somewhat more likely to be unable to repay investors the dividends they have promised or even to default altogether. Given this higher level of risk, such issues need to offer a higher dividend yield than other more creditworthy bonds. Over the last 10 years, these bonds have generally outperformed higher quality corporate bonds, but more recently, their performance has started to lag, especially since the COVID-19 crisis began. Another risk: High yield funds, unlike most other bond funds, are usually positively correlated with the overall US stock market. This means lower NAVs if stocks and the economy continue to be weak.\n\nAppraisal: If stocks continue to underperform from prior years as I expect, it is somewhat likely that these bonds won't do well either. In selecting such a fund, look for one with a high percentage of \"BB grade\" bonds; if unsure, check at the fund's website.\n\nInternational Bonds\n\nThese bonds can be either government and/or corporate bonds from countries around the world. They have done quite well over the 10 years through Dec. 2019, as compared to US bonds. However, this year so far things have reversed with international bonds fading quite a bit. Perhaps this is because international bonds are perceived as riskier than US bonds and many investors are interested in reducing risk right now.\n\nAppraisal: The COVID-19 crisis has likely made investors around the world favor US bonds as opposed to international ones. Extremely low or even negative interest rates in many foreign countries lessen the chance for above average returns.\n\nMunicipal Bonds\n\nTax-exempt municipal bonds generally perform in line with the overall taxable government bond market but with somewhat higher after-tax results for many investors. However, over the last year, muni bonds have lagged behind.\n\nAppraisal: Unless the Federal government provides substantial additional aid to states, many states (and localities) will suffer from severe financial shortfalls due to reduced tax-related inflows and higher spending levels to support their citizens, primarily as a result of the coronavirus job layoffs and lockdowns. This could likely cut into investors' willingness to buy and hold on to these types of bonds. But further down the road, tax rates may rise in order to help states balance their budgets, which might drive investor demand in order to seek out the tax-free income they offer. The result may be a mixed bag of performance for these funds.\n\nInflation-Protected Bonds\n\nInflation would seem to be the last thing to worry about now. But since these funds are composed of US government bonds which are adjusted for inflation, they have ridden the strong bandwagon for US bonds.\n\nAppraisal: While there is very little inflation now, the ever-expanding US budget deficit compounded by the crisis, may lead to somewhat greater inflation down the road, enhancing the attractiveness of these bonds.\n\nEmerging Market Bonds\n\nThese are among the riskiest bond funds one can own. They tend to be highly correlated with US stocks and also with emerging market stocks. Such funds tend to do best when the US dollar is weak; however, that is not the case now as investors worldwide flock to the perceived greater safety of US investments. These funds pay a high dividend, but so far this year, they have done very poorly on a total return basis, exacerbated by the crisis.\n\nAppraisal: Looking ahead, I would avoid these investments except for highly risk-tolerant investors.", "uri": "6054633253", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4342499-how-covidminus-19-may-affect-bond-etf-fund-performance"}], "6054505417": [822818602, {"sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "published_on": "2020-05-03T13:33:00Z", "name": "AMERISAFE, Inc.

Welcome to my isolation bubble. I hope you are safe and well. Our country and the workers' compensation market are currently facing health and economic uncertainties. Today's conversation looks to be much different than our focus on declining rates and competition just two short months ago during our year-end earnings call. What is not different is AMERISAFE's commitment to service. Throughout this pandemic, AMERISAFE's dedicated employees continue to serve our policyholders, agents and injured workers while protecting themselves and their households' health and safety. On behalf of myself and the Board, I would like to thank them for their remarkable dedication in these unprecedented times.\n\nThat dedication, coupled with AMERISAFE's operational discipline over the last 34 years, built a firm foundation of efficient operations with strong liquidity and no debt. In the current environment, our liquidity affords us the opportunity to maintain our workforce, pay our regular dividend and focus on our mission of providing quality insurance services. AMERISAFE and our policyholders are not immune from economic conditions, but I believe AMERISAFE is well positioned for what lies ahead. In the first quarter, we produced a combined ratio of 83.5% and an operating return on average equity of 16.1%. We are pleased with this result, particularly considering continued declines in underlying approved loss costs.\n\nOur ELCM for the quarter was 157, down from 159 in last year's first quarter. Voluntary policy count was down 2.2%, with renewal retention of 92.7%. As a result, premiums for policies written in the quarter were down 5.8%, while average approved loss costs for our classes of business were down 6.9%. For the quarter, audit premium and other adjustments increased gross premiums written $3.6 million. This was a $0.9 million decrease from the first quarter of 2019, which when combined with the decrease in written premium resulted in top line being down 6.5% from the first quarter of 2019. For the states that we operate in, stay-at-home orders impacted the second half of March. Our agents and policyholders were working, and AMERISAFE's operations were uninterrupted throughout the transition to work from home. Therefore, there was minimal impact to premiums in the first quarter related to the pandemic.\n\nNearly 95% of our policyholders report payrolls and pay premium to us on a monthly basis. In April, we received premium reports based on March payrolls. The reported premiums for those April reports based on March payrolls were approximately 8% lower than the amount we expected based on the policyholders' estimated annual premiums. Now that's not an exact science, but it's our best indication of how many of our insureds were working as stay-at-home orders were enacted. In our top 10 states, most of the larger classes of our businesses were not prohibited from working because of state guidance. We will have a better indication toward the end of May when April payrolls are reported to us.\n\nPayrolls for furloughed employees will be reported in a new class code, for which we will not collect premium. Our loss ratio for the quarter was 55.3%, with a current accident year loss ratio of 72.5%. The current accident year loss estimate was unchanged from accident year 2019. As with premium, we saw minimal impact to losses related to the coronavirus pandemic in the quarter. To date, we've had four COVID-19-related claims, mostly due to employers reporting out of an abundance of caution. There is an ongoing debate in the industry and among states regarding the compensability of coronavirus claims as workers' compensation. We agree with the industry experts that the cost of this pandemic were not considered and/or contemplated in the rate nor in reinsurance agreements.\n\nIf healthcare workers and first responders are deemed as covered under workers' compensation, AMERISAFE would have a very small exposure, mostly through our assigned risk policies. In the near term, our overall reported claim counts have declined. We experienced $13.6 million of favorable development from prior accident years in the quarter. That favorable development primarily resulted from individual claim severities being less than anticipated. The stress on the healthcare industry and the delay of doctors' appointments and procedures could impact ultimate severity of claims depending on the length of state restrictions. Our ability to work with claimants, employers and healthcare providers to achieve maximum medical improvement and return the injured worker to work are essential. Anything delaying those outcomes, whether medical or return-to-work-related impacts our ability to close claims.\n\nI'll now turn the call over to Neal to discuss the financial results for the quarter.\n\nNeal Fuller\n\nThank you, Janelle, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2020, AMERISAFE reported net income of $10.8 million or $0.56 per diluted share compared with $19.4 million or $1.01 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. Operating net income for the first quarter was $16.9 million or $0.88 per share, a decrease of $0.03 from the first quarter of 2019. Revenues in the quarter were impacted by $8.8 million in unrealized losses on equity securities and therefore decreased to $79.2 million compared with $95.2 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net premiums earned decreased 7% to $79 million when compared to last year's first quarter, driven by continued declines in state loss cost rates and competition.\n\nTurning to our investment portfolio. Our net investment income decreased 3.3% in the first quarter to $7.7 million compared with $8 million in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease was driven by lower interest rates on fixed income securities, particularly on cash and short-term investment securities. The tax-equivalent yield on our investment portfolio was 3.03% at the end of the first quarter. The pre-tax yield on the portfolio was 2.70% at the end of the quarter, down from 2.82% one year ago. Realized gains for the portfolio on securities sold were $1 million compared with negligible gains in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nThe investment portfolio is high quality, carrying an average AA credit rating with duration of 3.87 and with 62% in municipal bonds, 19% in corporate bonds, and 10% in U.S. treasuries and agencies, 2% in equity securities and 7% in cash and other investments. We do not invest in the following securities: no high-yield bonds, no private placements, no bank loans or CLOS, no limited partnerships or any other exotic securities. Within our 21% allocation to corporate bonds, we have no BBB minus- securities, 7% in BBB, 4% in BBB+ and the remaining 8% in A- and above-rated securities. Within our 62% allocation to municipal loans, we have no BBB securities, 5% are single A bonds, 41% are AA bonds and 16% are rated AAA. These are all reported as a percentage of the total portfolio.\n\nApproximately 60% of our bond portfolio is comprised of held-to-maturity securities, which were in a net unrealized gain position of $23.1 million at quarter end. These unrealized gains are not reflected in our book value as these bonds are carried at amortized costs. The company has strong liquidity with $97 million currently in cash and overnight investments, which are held in the U.S. treasury money market fund. The company has $39 million of U.S. treasury securities that mature in less than 12 months, $73 million of additional U.S. treasury and agency securities and $186 million of additional maturities and interest coupons of other bonds in the next 12 months. The total of all of these is $395 million.\n\nDuring the quarter, we implemented the new accounting standard related to current expected credit losses, or CECL. This resulted in the after-tax charge to retained earnings of $594,000 effective January 1, 2020, or $0.03 per share. The new credit loss allowance balances at March 31, 2020, included an allowance for reinsurance recoverable of $449,000 and an allowance for held-to-maturity investments of $275,000, both were in line with the ranges of potential impacts that we disclosed in our previous SEC filings.\n\nMoving now to operating expenses. Our total underwriting and other expenses were $21.3 million in the quarter compared with $20.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase was largely due to higher insurance-related assessments, which increased expenses by $500,000 compared to last year's first quarter when we had some favorable downward adjustments to assessments. By category, the 2020 first quarter expenses included: $7 million of salaries and benefits; $6.1 million in commissions; and $8.2 million of underwriting and other costs. As a result of the decline in earned premium as well as slightly higher expenses, our expense ratio for the quarter was 26.9% compared with 24.3% in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 18.4% compared to 18.5% for last year's first quarter. Return on equity for the first quarter was 10% compared to 18.5% for the first quarter of 2019. Operating ROE for the quarter was 16.1%. In capital management, our company paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share in the first quarter, which represented an 8% increase over last year's amount. This quarter, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share, payable on June 26, 2020, to shareholders of record as of June 12, 2020. And finally, just a couple of other topics. Book value per share at March 31, 2020, was $22.64, up 1.6% from $22.29 at year-end. Our statutory surplus was $371 million at quarter end, up from $360 million at December 31, 2019. And lastly, we will be filing our Form 10-Q with the SEC today after market close.\n\nThat concludes my remarks, and we would now like to open up the call for the question-and-answer session. Operator?\n\nAnd we will take our first question today from Randy Binner with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\n\nRandyBinner\n\nGood morning. Thanks. I guess for me, the first area to focus on is claim counts being lower. I think you mentioned that in the opening script. But I don't believe that was quantified as much as what you saw with payroll audits and potential impacts from categories you insure kind of from a top line perspective. So can you dimension for us what the kind of the lower loss element of this new economy might be for AMERISAFE?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes. Randy, this is Janelle. So yes, I did say in my prepared remarks that we're seeing lower claim counts currently in terms of just reported claims coming in the door. We did have 1, what we would call severe loss in the quarter, one compared to accident year 2019 that ended at 17 claims ultimately. But I think in the first quarter, it's pretty much the same, one claim. So we are seeing lower claim counts now. I think what if I'm reading your or hearing your question correctly, what how will this impact the ultimate cost of our claims?\n\nInitially, when the stay-at-home orders started and work for everyone was transitioning from work from home, there were certainly some delays just getting things set up from a vendor side, not necessarily AMERISAFE employees working. But obviously, all the different state agencies and workers' compensation commissions, all the people that we have to deal with, were also transitioning from home. So I think there was some delay just maybe that first couple of weeks. But now all of that seems to be online and working. We had delayed doctors' appointments, obviously for so in compliance with stay-at-home orders.\n\nBut I think things like telemed is now live and well, and especially with our clients, their appointment. So we are getting doctors' appointments taken care of. As states start opening up, I believe procedures will be taken care of. But there have been delays from that aspect. At this point, will that increase the severity of our claims? I think it really depends on the length of the stay-at-home orders. And of course, that varies by state.\n\nRandyBinner\n\nSo a couple of follow-ups. One, I guess, is understanding so someone who had a medical visit delayed would have ostensibly, they'd be injured before all this happened. But now you're dealing with kind of lower economic activity. So I guess you could have a construction worker who maybe still is on payroll but not working as much. Is there potentially an element to the claim profile like analogous to auto insurance, where there are less vehicles, there's less accidents? Or does payroll, workers' comp correlate more closely to how the losses would be expected to come in?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes. That's a great question. So yes, certainly, if our insureds, our policyholders aren't working and but they have their workers still on the payroll, I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a new class code now that they can report those premiums or that payroll under this class code so that they don't have to pay workers' compensation premium on that. On the flip side, to your point, that also means we wouldn't have claims related to those employer employees not working.\n\nRandyBinner\n\nOkay. And then I guess I'll ask one more and then leave it to the other analysts. But just within construction and trucking, which are your largest two classes, are those in the states where you do business? Have those been deemed essential activities and have kept going? And maybe in the case of trucking, you maybe even see some more activity?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes. So I'll address the latter first. Yes, we would anticipate, from a trucking standpoint, just getting goods, and the job being getting toilet paper across the United States. The trucking industry would have been alive and well and perhaps robust through these weeks of stay at home and isolation. For construction, same. For at least our top 10 states, in most of our states, when we look through, to your point, things that were listed as essential businesses in state orders, construction wasn't limited. The only state I can think of top of mind was Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania did limit construction and had a stay-at-home order for construction.\n\nSo in the interim, that certainly could impact our insureds. But we believe, at this point, time will tell, we believe our insureds do have the opportunity to work related to COVID-related stay-at-home orders. I guess the larger concern would be if there is a recession or whatever the term we want to pick is for today. They may have jobs now. They may have contracts now. What happens eventually as companies are watching liquidity, do they still have the same capital expenditures? Will there be some sort of compression on construction? The flip side of that is, we've heard, if you listened to any of the presidential or federal news conferences or even some of the Congress news conferences, you'll hear a lot about infrastructure. So I think there's going to be things out there to stimulate the economy that should benefit AMERISAFE policyholders.\n\nOur next question comes from Matt Carletti with AMP. Please go ahead.\n\nMattCarletti\n\nThanks. It's Matt at JMP. A couple of questions. The first is, you guys have always prided yourselves, and I'd say a real kind of hallmark of AMERISAFE has been your pre-quote safety inspections, kind of the extra mile that you go to make sure you really understand your insureds or potential insureds. Can you talk a little bit about how that process likely has changed in the stay-at-home environment?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes, certainly. So I believe and I might get the date the exact date wrong. But I'll say in mid-March, around March 17, is when we made the call to say, you know what, it's not safe for our employees, it's not safe for our customers and our safety professionals to transition from work from home. And you think, OK, they're safety professionals, how are they working from home? They were quite creative. And yes, we've been doing virtual safety visits using any technology that we can to talk to policyholders and potential policyholders, help them with safety recommendations and do as many safety visits as we can use virtual means. So that has not prevented us from issuing quotes as this as the stay-at-home, isolations have happened. That's still we're still very much open for business and writing policies.\n\nMattCarletti\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then as I think about kind of follow-on to what Randy was asking, that last question there about kind of the auto exposure and does payroll adjust, is there an inherent benefit in trucking? I mean you guys have talked about for a long time across your whole business that the biggest cause of loss is vehicular accidents. And if traffic's down 40%, we're hearing from commercial auto insurers that there's they're seeing a drop of accidents there, too, even though trucking mileage might not be down because there's just less cars on the road. Is that potentially, even if it's just short term, a benefit to AMERISAFE? Are you seeing any of that in your numbers yet?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nGreat question and we hope that is the case. So yes, anything if there's less vehicles on the road that certainly decreases our chances of a motor vehicle accident. I don't I think it's probably too early to say. So far, we've been tracking it based on different states, and we haven't seen I mean it's been a kind of a puller drop by state consistent drop by state rather than seeing fluctuations in different pockets. But that is something that I think is a possibility and certainly welcome.\n\nMattCarletti\n\nOkay. Great. Last one, just could you just give a little color on the what you're seeing competitively in the market, just even as we kind of entered the year, and then if there has been any change in the last month to six weeks with COVID, from your competitors, your competitors that might have exposures to other classes, whether that be more of the first responders, whether that be more retail or things like that? Just have you seen any real change in competitive environment in your markets? Or has it just kind of been a little more status quo?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes. So I'll say I'll speak to two different things pre-COVID and then now. So pre-COVID, no, there was really no change in the competition from when we spoke at the end of February. And still workers' comp was a line that people were pursuing. Now that we're post or into COVID, not post, I wish we were post-COVID, it will be interesting to see what happens. Because I think there's a concern over the industry about what's going to be compensable. So I mean, for AMERISAFE, we think we're somewhat protected in that. As we talked about, the things that you think about that are having COVID-related claims at this point are not things that we typically write with the exception of a small portion of our assigned risk book.\n\nBut I think it may be enough deterrent to keep companies or for companies that to allocate capital perhaps to different lines of business if they're a multi-line carrier. Earlier in the call, we were talking about auto. So I think auto is looking more attractive, and I welcome that. So yes, as this continues, one of our hopes would be that multi-line carriers may deploy their capital elsewhere, particularly if they're looking trying to project ahead at what payrolls could be what payroll could be doing in the economy, where are we headed. Perhaps they would think let's get something not as tied to payrolls.\n\nMattCarletti\n\nGot you. And then just a follow-on on the compensability issue, and I understand it's pretty small exposure for you guys. But am I thinking about it right that if that were to catch on, if that were to kind of be deemed in a large portion of states to be covered for those that have that exposure, that would ultimately work its way into loss cost, correct? I mean there's a delayed impact there but...\n\nYes. There's no reason to think that it would be treated otherwise than just how it shows up in the numbers and then work its way in the rates?\n\nGreat. Wonderful. Well thank you for all the color and best of luck\n\nAnd we'll take the next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.\n\nMarkHughes\n\nThank you. Good morning I apologize; I missed the early part of the call. But did you comment on the any observations on small business, your smaller accounts versus larger accounts, whether you're seeing any more dislocation? And in the context of any a broader commentary on cancellations or midterm premium adjustments, have you seen anything on that front?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes. So I'll start with the small business aspect of what we write. One of the concerns going into COVID and was what happens to small businesses, so we were very happy to see the stimulus available too we would think our insured base would be have access to that fund. So that's a good sign for us. Even if we don't collect premium on those particular payrolls, anything that keeps them going and viable throughout this isolation is good for AMERISAFE. But as I was saying, I think in part, at least we believe, the industries that we insure are working. So as long as they have a contract or a job, we think that they've been working in most of our states, with the exception I mentioned of Pennsylvania.\n\nConstruction was not considered \"essential\" in Pennsylvania. So that, I guess, is a downside. But we think the small and midsized businesses, at least, if they were had the ability to work and the cash flows to work, they could continue to work throughout this, which is, I think, been a major concern in the country, right? How does small businesses if they had to close for a month or two months, how do they survive? For our insured base or our policyholders, we don't think that, that is the case. So that's a good sign.\n\nYou asked about payrolls, and I guess that may have been before you joined the call or whatever the case may be. I did give a little bit of forward-looking in terms of what we saw in April. So in April, we received monthly reports based on March payrolls. And granted, I think most of the isolations kind of affected the second half of March, but it still gave us some indication. And those payrolls were about 8% less than we would have expected. But I have to qualify that, expected based on their estimated annual premium. Obviously, that's not an exact science. But it gives us some indication. We'll have a better indication at the end of May once we've received those April payrolls. Because I think once we got into April, things were pretty settled in terms of who's working, who's not working.\n\nWith the exception of, like I said if they had a job and was currently working on a job and I'm using construction as my example. If they were currently working on a job, I'll use the construction crew outside of our offices here in DeRidder, they were working. Even when our employees' transition to work from home, they were still working on the highway outside. They were completing that job. So I think as long as those jobs were there, they were going to be working and complete them. Does that answer your question?\n\nMarkHughes\n\nIt sure does. And then could you refresh us on the dynamics?\n\nNealFuller\n\nMark, let me add on. Mark, sorry, just let me add on. You may have missed this too in Janelle's remarks. 95% of our policyholders' report on a monthly basis. And so there are not a lot of midterm cancellations or midterm endorsements from that standpoint. And so far, retention has been holding in good in the month of March, and we haven't seen any uptick in cancellations.\n\nMarkHughes\n\nVery helpful. And then refresh me on the dynamic on your construction book. How much is, say, new construction versus maintenance, repair, that sort of thing?\n\nNealFuller\n\nWe don't have a breakout on that. A lot of our roofing, for instance, though, is commercial construction. It's not residential construction. Only about 5% would be considered residential in terms of roofing. So it's commercial restructuring. I think in terms of categories of business that I see the most, just and this is anecdotally, it's a lot of remodeling of buildings, remodeling of schools, that type of thing.\n\nMarkHughes\n\nVery good. And I'll just ask one more. I know you've already given the loss cost multiplier in the quarter.\n\nAnd we'll now go to Ron Bobman with Capital Returns. Please go ahead.\n\nRonBobman\n\nHi, good morning. I had two questions. Janelle, if I were to look at the current developed loss ratio, whether it be for AMERISAFE or other comp writers for the 2007 accident year, where it's currently developed, and I compare that to a meaningfully worse, let's say, currently developed 2010 year, and I looked at the change, and while we're in the midst of this pandemic, who knows what how it's going to develop and what the economy response is going to be and the severity, etc., what are some of the things that come to your mind that make that delta that I'm pointing to, 2007 versus, let's say, 2010, a good indicator what make what may make 2019 versus 2000 and I'm sorry, 2019 versus, say, 2022 and the change that we might see there between those two accident years, sort of a greater delta or a lesser delta? What are some of the sort of things that come to mind as you think about that type of analysis and trying to look to the past as a little bit of a reference guide?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes. We've certainly been doing that, look at the past and say, OK, what happened in the Great I don't know if we'll call it the Great Recession anymore, but in the Great Recession compared to what we think maybe may happen in the next year to two years. When I think back to live in the moment at accident year 2010, I remember thinking, \"Oh, this is bad, right?\" And for us, for the industry, we all felt like we got it wrong. Return to work was a huge component of what we do, and there weren't jobs to go back to. And we increased our loss ratio. I think we had one quarter of a very small amount of adverse development, which is very atypical for us, albeit it happened.\n\nAnd now sitting here today, looking back at accident year 2010, at least for AMERISAFE, and I probably should know the industry numbers off the top of my head, but at least for AMERISAFE when I look back, it wasn't as bad as we thought it was at the time, in terms of accident year 2010. But that period that you're talking about, 2007, 2008, 2009 to 2010, what's different, I think, is the underlying rate. So we were at a higher rate, I think the industry as a whole; I know AMERISAFE was at a higher rate premium per $100 of payroll then than we are now. So I think the rate environment was a little bit different.\n\nNealFuller\n\nI think the frequency and severity of accidents was also quite a bit different. The long-term trend has trended down quite a bit since then as workplaces have become safer, and there's been more emphasis by employers on safer workplaces.\n\nRonBobman\n\nOkay. And I have another sort of a more general question. And I know you're specialists, you're you've been in it, and you'll continue to be in it for the long haul. And of course, you look to support your insureds as best you reasonably can. And I'm just sort of thinking, when you were in this environment that we're in right now, we're to be looking at and quoting or at least being asked to quote on a new piece of business. Given all the financial distress, is the bar a hell of a lot higher now for you to even candidly consider quoting and binding a new piece of business, given the financial distress that the insured is presumably sort of undergoing and the uncertainty as to whether they'll make it out the other end and what the future holds?\n\nJanelleFrost\n\nYes. It's interesting. I think part of the answer to that question is how long this lasts in terms of this isolation, stay-at-home orders, and people running out of jobs to or contracts to complete. So the length of it, I said, certainly matters. As we got into April, we were still getting new business submissions because agents had been working those months in advance. The longer agents are isolated, the less new business that's going to be presented to us because they're going to have less new business, right?\n\nBecause at that point, if they're going to be looking through their books of business, trying to figure out, OK, what what's out there that I can resubmit, because they're not prospecting when they're at home. So it'd be interesting to see how much new business we have. I think everyone is going to try to protect the renewal business. I think insureds are going to be more I hope insureds are more inclined to stay with their renewals with their renewing company simply because, to your point, with all the other moving pieces out there, I think one thing one less thing to worry about is what do I need to do about my comp coverage.\n\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Janelle Frost, President and CEO, for concluding remarks.\n\nJanelle Frost\n\nThank you for joining us today. This is a unique time in our country, in the insurance market and in our personal lives. As each day of this pandemic passes, we learn more, we adjust and we adapt. At AMERISAFE, we found new, creative ways to stay connected and serve our clients from isolation. For me personally, I've clicked more in the last month than I have in my lifetime. I'm sure my family would agree, and AMERISAFE is doing a better job at adapting. Stay well.\n\nAnd that does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation. And you may now disconnect.", "uri": "6054505417", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4342441-amerisafe-inc-amsf-ceo-janelle-frost-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"}], "6073386850": [449462170, {"sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "published_on": "2020-05-19T18:30:00Z", "name": "Polk Commission OKs funds for COVID-19 testing", "dtype": "news", "pk": 449462170, "text": "Polk County will expand COVID-19 testing with some of the $126 million it received from the federal government under the CARES Act.\n\nThis content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. Please support local journalism by subscribing to theledger.com at https://www.theledger.com/subscribenow.\n\nBARTOW -- The Polk County Commission on Tuesday approved spending $2 million on an expanded coronavirus testing program for county and municipal employees in Polk County cities.\n\nThe money will come from the $126 million the county government received last month under the CARES Act, the $2.2 trillion federal aid package Congress passed to help the U.S. economy rebound from the COVID-19-related economic shutdown.\n\nThe money will support both COVID-19 diagnostic testing at $100 per person and a blood test for antibodies to the disease at $50 per test, County Manager Bill Beasley said. The latter test will be used as a tool to estimate the extent of COVID-19 infections in the general Polk population.\n\nThe Polk County Fire Rescue Service plans to begin an initial round of antibodies testing for its personnel Tuesday, said Paul Banerjee, a physician and medical director. It can do 100 tests per day.\n\nA second round of testing for Fire Rescue workers will run in July and December, he said.\n\nThat testing will seek to determine how many additional employees have obtained the COVID-19 antibodies and whether employees positive for the antibodies in previous tests still have them, Banerjee said.\n\n\"This will be very helpful in helping determine the extent of the spread in Polk County,\" he said.\n\nCOVID-19 researchers don't know how long a person retains COVID-19 antibodies, Banerjee added, and the three testing intervals will help determine that.\n\nAfter the initial round of Fire Rescue testing, workers in the Polk County Sheriff's Office will be offered the test beginning June 8, Banerjee said.\n\nIt will be extended to other county employees whose jobs entail a lot of personal contact with citizens beginning June 15, he said, and to municipal law enforcement and fire department beginning June 22.\n\nThe antibodies test also is helpful because some people get infected with the coronavirus but do not show COVID-19 symptoms, Banejee said. Such employees will be given a COVID-19 diagnostic test immediately to ensure they aren't spreading the disease.\n\nBeasley also updated the commission on his discussions with local hospital executives about expanding diagnostic testing in the county.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health in Polk County has set a goal of testing 500 tests per day, equivalent to 2% of the population each month. The department is currently testing about 450 people per day.\n\nThe hospital executives talked about setting up diagnostic testing sites in \"targeted communities\" at high risk of infection, said Beasley. They've not yet determined those communities.\n\nThe county has set aside $30 million for COVID-19 testing and purchasing personal protection equipment for health care workers from its $126 million CARES funding.\n\nBeasley also told the commission he is preparing a letter to the state that will recommend re-opening the Legoland theme park in Winter Haven. That letter, plus one from the city of Winter Haven, is required under Gov. Ron DeSantis' recent executive order establishing guidelines for reopening the state's theme parks and attractions.\n\nTuesday was the first day the county began accepting applications from small businesses and individuals for assistance with their economic losses because of the COVID-19 economic shutdown.\n\nThe county has set aside $40 million from its CARES allocation for small business relief to companies employing 25 or fewer people. Companies can get grants of up to $5,000 for losses directly related to COVID.\n\nThe county also set aside $30 million for individuals who've lost income during the shutdown to help with living expenses such as rent and mortgage payments and utility bills.\n\nIn other business, the commission approved refinancing $43 million of 2010 municipal bonds that supported transportation and infrastructure improvements.\n\nThe refinancing will save the county $3.7 million in interest payments through the end of the bond payoff period in December 2029, which did not change, said Stacy Butterfield, the Polk comptroller and clerk of courts. The refinancing lowered the interest rate to 1.95% from $2.46% originally.\n\nButterfield told the commission she could begin sending checks out to small businesses found eligible for CARES money as early as Wednesday if their applications have been approved by the end of Tuesday.\n\nThe commission also ratified Beasley's decision to hire Benjamin Dunn as the new director of the Building Department, which handles approving building permits and doing inspections.\n\nDunn started his career in the Polk Building Department 20 years ago before taking a similar position as director of the Highlands County Developmental Services Department five years ago, Beasley said. He was hired at an annual salary of $110,286 plus benefits.\n\nKevin Bouffard can be reached at kevin.bouffard@theledger.com or at 863-802-7591.", "uri": "6073386850", "url": "https://www.theledger.com/news/20200519/polk-commission-oks-funds-for-covid-19-testing?rssfeed=true"}], "6073282411": [988413381, {"sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "published_on": "2020-05-19T17:37:00Z", "name": "Sebi allows select mutual funds to make additional investment in govt", "dtype": "news", "pk": 988413381, "text": "Markets regulator Sebi has allowed mutual funds to make additional investment in government securities and treasury bills while deciding on investment avenues for their corporate bond, banking, PSU and credit risk funds, industry sources said.\n\nThis follows a request from industry body Amfi (Association of Mutual Funds in India) and fund houses seeking an increase in exposure of government securities in mutual fund schemes.

For the next step, we must further increase the fiscal deficit ratio [as a percentage of GDP], issue special treasury bonds and increase the issuance of special purpose bonds [by local governments].\n\n\"These measures can promptly and effectively respond to the impact of the outbreak on China's economy and employment.\"\n\nXiao's comments mirror general proposals already made by the State Council, the details of which will be announced at the NPC, which starts on Friday.\n\nRecently Liu Shangxi, an adviser to the Ministry of Finance, said the central bank should consider buying the new treasury bonds directly from the finance ministry, a form of QE.\n\nLiu's suggestion triggered a heated debate over whether the People's Bank of China should monetise the government's fiscal deficit, although the law currently prohibits the central bank from financing government deficits.\n\nXiao's opposition to QE was echoed by Ma Jun, a central bank policy adviser, who said in an article published on Sunday by the official Financial News, that the People's Bank should refrain from buying special treasury bonds because such a move could fuel inflation risks and asset bubbles and lead to depreciation of the yuan currency.\n\nMa, who is a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee and its former chief economist, warned that if the PBOC were to engage in a QE programme, it would \"in turn encourage excessive fiscal debt, which may trigger a crisis of confidence in government debt in the international market. The credit rating of national sovereign debt may therefore be downgraded and financing costs may rise\".\n\n\"Even with the severe impact of the coronavirus, China still maintains a positive interest rate, and traditional monetary policy tools still have a lot of room,\" Ma said, adding that there were signs that\n\nChina's economy had started to recover in the second quarter.\n\nWu Xiaoling, the former deputy governor of the PBOC, argued in another Financial News article that it was \"unnecessary\" for the central bank to purchase government bonds to fund fiscal deficit.\n\n\"If there is need in the market, the central bank can provide liquidity in a variety of ways, including buying government bonds to provide liquidity,\" Wu said.\n\n\"But we should still tighten control of fiscal expenditures, improve the efficiency of the use of fiscal funds, maintain fiscal discipline, and maintain the healthy development of the Chinese economy.\"\n\nFormer PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan also warned that the \"side effects\" of QE could prevent government resources from getting to those most in need.\n\n\"Loose liquidity may also have certain side effects in the future, and there will be some 'free riders',\" Zhou told the China Fortune Media Group on Saturday.\n\n\"That is to say, some enterprises and financial institutions had their own problems and were already in trouble. But they also could take the opportunity to say that these problems were caused by the coronavirus, so should they be rescued?\"\n\nAnalysts said it was unlikely that China would emulate the Fed's QE measures despite weaker growth prospects this year.\n\n\"Chinese stimulus tends to work through a combination of monetary and fiscal measures. For instance, local government bond issuance is bought by state and commercial banks, with the PBOC ensuring sufficient liquidity for the transactions to occur,\" said Rory Green, China economist at TS Lombard.\n\n\"If the PBOC was to purchase the special treasury bond directly this would be a clear change in stimulus method. Such a PBOC purchase would essentially be a form of QE. Beijing has explicitly vowed not to utilise QE so this kind of PBOC purchase is unlikely.\"", "uri": "6072286532", "url": "https://www.intellasia.net/coronavirus-china-doesnt-need-big-economic-stimulus-advisers-and-former-officials-say-781254"}], "6072079834": [880459003, {"sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "published_on": "2020-05-18T18:25:00Z", "name": "Sebi eases categorisation norms to allow debt MFs to add liquidity", "dtype": "news", "pk": 880459003, "text": "The regulator has temporarily revised the scheme categorisation norms to make the option available for MFs.

Suspending the limit would make municipal bonds more attractive for high-income retail customers.\n\nA direct-pay bond similar to the 2009 Build America Bonds program would be beneficial, Gee said, but he is concerned about sequestration on the subsidy payments the federal government put in place in subsequent years on BABs and could that happen again.\n\n\"So if something like that was proposed, I would personally advocate that that subsidy not be cut,\" Gee said. \"I think that [sequestration] creates uncertainty in the market when you have an instrument like that. It's not to say it wasn't beneficial, it was, you have to rely on whatever criteria is developed, is not going to be changed.\"\n\nThe taxable market has been doing relatively well on its own over the past year, leading to the notion that direct-pay bonds may face hurdles.\n\nGee called the taxable market growth an \"anomaly\" and a short-term solution, which is why he is pursuing advance refunding.\n\n\"We were very fortunate in that the taxable rates were such that there was an opportunity for a lot of folks to use that to do refundings of debt,\" Gee said.\n\nGee wants to see federal funding more directly to local governments. Current legislation under the CARES Act funnels money to states and cities with larger populations where they then would give funds to smaller municipalities.\n\n\"You're at the mercy of your particular state as to how much you get and how you can spend those funds,\" Gee said. \"I would like to see something made available so that those municipalities can apply and receive funding directly from the federal government.\"\n\nIn his one-year term, Gee also wants to get high school and college students involved in public finance.\n\nWestern Kentucky-born Gee has an 18-year history with the GFOA. He was chair and co-chair of its Committee on Treasury and Investment Management committee and was an ex-offico for GFOA's Committee on Governmental Debt Management.\n\nGee was not interested in public finance when he finished his accounting degree at the University of Louisville. His first job was working at an auditor public account office and then went to spend two decades in Lousiville, Kentucky as controller at the Louisville Water Co. and then went to work for its sewer utility as the director of finance.\n\nIn Louisville, he fell in love with public finance.\n\n\"It felt like I was contributing something,\" Gee said. \"You're not really focused as much on profits, and certainly that's important, but your main focus is on providing the services that your constituents and that your customers need. I really enjoyed that aspect of public finance. That's what compelled me to stay in it.\"\n\nHe later became San Antonio's assistant finance director before moving to St. Louis about five years ago.\n\nIn his free time, Gee likes to watch college basketball and football, but also dabbles in theatre.

In the space of just nine trading sessions, for example, the iShares National Muni Bond MUB, +0.23% plunged 13.7%, in one fell swoop wiping out years of any benefit that munis otherwise have over other bonds. High-yield munis performed far worse: The Van-Eck Vectors High Yield Municipal Index ETF HYD, +0.24% fell 36% from late February through mid-March.\n\nThe muni market in April quieted down somewhat from that extraordinary burst of volatility, and muni bonds have recovered some (though not all) of their mid-March losses. With the dust mostly settled, gutsy retirees and soon-to-be retirees are wondering if they should either return to the muni arena or even increase their pre-existing exposure.\n\nOne initial sign that it might be safe to return is that the premium/discount to NAV at which muni ETFs are trading have returned to low levels. As you can see from the accompanying chart, the MUB traded at an extraordinary 5.8% discount to its NAV on Mar. 18, after having continuously traded over prior months at a tiny discount or premium. This revealed a huge amount of turmoil in the muni market. Since then, as you can see, the MUB has return to trading at close to pre-March norms.\n\nTo be sure, that doesn't mean muni bonds represent attractive investment opportunities. It just means that the market is once again trading in an orderly fashion, which I consider to be a prerequisite to even considering the sector.\n\nFor starters, let's compare muni bonds to Treasurys, where munis certainly appear to be the far better bets. An investment-grade muni with a 10-year maturity currently yields significantly more than the 10-year Treasury, for example -- 0.91% versus 0.68%. That's just the opposite of the historical norms, since munis typically yield less than comparable Treasurys, given that they are exempt from federal taxes. The fact that they are not suggests munis are far more out of favor right now than Treasurys.\n\nOther things being equal, therefore, munis are more preferable than Treasurys for the fixed income portion of your portfolio.\n\nBut are other things equal? Many say \"no,\" because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has imperiled the finances of many muni bond issuers -- in particular states and municipalities. This concern about default risk has been exacerbated by comments in April by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that states and cities should declare bankruptcy rather than rely on a federal government bailout.\n\nThis concern about default risk is exaggerated, however, according to many muni advisers I follow. Legal experts contend that it would be unconstitutional for the federal government to allow states to declare bankruptcy, for example. In any case, many of those advisers add, the last thing the Federal government wants right now (despite what it might say) is for there to be a rash of state and city bankruptcies. And though there is debate in Washington over the specifics of a stimulus program for states and localities, most seem to believe that some sort of stimulus will be passed.\n\nMunis versus corporate bonds\n\nThe choice retirees and soon-to-be retirees have to make for the fixed income portions of their portfolios isn't just between munis and Treasurys, of course. Another option is corporate bonds.\n\nAnd default risk is a good segue into discussing them, since that risk is not insignificant among corporate bond issuers. Historically, in fact, corporate bond default rates have been far higher than for munis.\n\nFor purposes of discussion, however, let's assume default risks between the two are comparable. On this generous assumption, once we control for credit quality, muni rates should be equivalent on an after-tax basis to corporate bond rates.\n\nAre they? The table below shows recent rates, courtesy of the St. Louis Federal Reserve and Bloomberg:\n\nMaturity Investment grade corporate bond average Corporate bond after-tax yield for investor in 35% bracket Investment grade muni bond average 1 year 1.46% 0.95% 0.17% 2 years 1.53% 0.99% 0.24% 5 years 1.78% 1.16% 0.52% 10 years 2.77% 1.80% 0.91% 30 years 3.24% 2.11% 1.81%\n\nNotice that throughout the maturity spectrum investment grade bonds are yielding more on an after-tax basis than comparable munis. From this you can conclude that one of two things must be true:\n\n*Investment grade corporate bonds are better bargains right now than munis;\n\n*The default risk for issuers of investment grade corporates is significantly higher than for munis.\n\nIt's beyond the scope of this column to take a position on which of these two is the correct answer. But what this discussion does is focus your attention on the right questions to ask. If you're comfortable that default risk isn't higher for corporates than for munis, you would want to favor investment grade corporates for the fixed income portion of your portfolio. To the extent you don't, munis become increasingly attractive.\n\nTaxes\n\nThe presupposition of this discussion is that you're investing in a taxable account, of course. If you're investing in a 401(k), IRA, or some other tax-deferred account, however, then munis' after-tax yields will be the same as their headline yields. In that event, you would choose munis only to the extent that their headline yields are in excess of those of comparable bonds that are not munis.

That was over a month ago, and according to Bernstein Private Wealth Management's cohead of investment strategies, Beata Kirr, the questions have already changed. \"A month ago, the key client question was, 'When's it going to stop? Am I going to be okay? How big is the decline going to be?'\"\n\nAt the end of April when we spoke to Kirr (pictured left), they'd begun receiving questions such as, 'What's with the disconnect in the market going up versus the economic headlines and how I feel?', 'What does that mean for the back half of this year? Do we expect the markets to pivot again? Keep it downside? Or are we off to the races?', 'How do we fix this?', 'Where does this go long-term?', 'When's the vaccine?' and 'How do we get out of it?'\n\nWorth caught up with Kirr, who is also the host of Bernstein's Women & Wealth podcast, to discuss not only the top questions their clients are asking, but also how this pandemic is affecting women founders and entrepreneurs financially and how it could affect economic equality.\n\nQ: So to start, I'm curious how you've seen the coronavirus pandemic affect female founders and female business owners from a financial perspective?\n\nA: Well, you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that there is not one answer to that question. I think it's very dependent on the size of their business, on where the business is in its life cycle and what their household situation looks like. So I'm not sure the answer would be any different for men, frankly. But I think we often find that if the female founder or the female executive or the female business owner in any of those settings has amazing household help and a splitting of duties then I think the path is easier, to probably state the obvious, than otherwise. And I think that the harsh reality is that many female founders do also have working spouses or partners, and it's tough out there for anybody that's trying to homeschool and manage a household and have a full-time job.\n\nI think whether you're a female founder or whether you're a female professional, everybody's kind of in the same boat. I think there's been a lot of conversations about...when you're on a Zoom call and the kids or pets come, is it viewed differently for women versus men? And I don't have the answer to that. I would just observe that it happens.\n\nWhat are the most common challenges you've seen female founders and entrepreneurs face during this pandemic and are they different from what you've seen for men?\n\nI think I'd come back to that the women are talking about what's going on with the kids and how difficult it is to manage homeschooling in addition to managing their business. And I don't as often hear that talk track, perhaps, from men. But I do think everybody is tired, and it's hard on everybody to be sequestered in their home. So I think that is consistent across gender. But I do think the house management duties, in addition to the children, have historically fallen disproportionately on women. And I think there's a lot of evidence around that in terms of the caretaking duties. So I think the biggest challenge has been that it's still falling on women; yet, everybody's working 24/7 by video at home. So that's even harder than normal.\n\nSince we work with high net worth clients, much of our client base, in terms of who I've interacted with and talking to some of our FAs who they're most closely interacting with is... it's the women that have been in a position to have a lot of household help and frankly many of them don't have spouses that work because they are very senior executives. And so I think that... a lot of the women that we've heard from are more fortunate in that chain, if you will. But we certainly also talked to women who are currently founding businesses and start mode, but of course they don't tend to be our clients because they haven't had that success yet. So I think we've had a disproportionate view into that lens from the women that have household situations where it's easier. Not in any way saying it's easy, but that is the lens from which we see it.\n\nDo you have any investing advice for business owners and executives in light of the pandemic?\n\nI think the blanket statement, \"However you are invested is how you should stay invested\" is not necessarily true in this setting because if the majority of your cash flow or your life savings is invested in a business that will not be able to survive this because of the lack of cash flow for a period of time and do not get financing, then thinking about your access to personal capital might mean a very different asset allocation than one that you started with before. So I think the advice there is no different than it would be whether you're a business owner or executive. It's really about the need for cash flow. Whether you've had a change for short-term cash needs. And if you have, that means investing 80 percent equities in the market may not be the right approach.\n\nNow again, for most business owners I would say that they don't have a lot of cash flows invested in the market because they tend to be investing in their business so substantially and continuously reinvesting. So I think that there's less of that exposure. So I think it just comes back to testing the cash flow and their wherewithal to make it through what could be two months or what could be six months. I think that's what made this situation so incredibly challenging for every type of company. That there's just not that visibility on what the path looks like from here. So base-case, best-case, worst-case scenarios, looking at personal finance and business cash flows is, I think, the way that we've had to do it.\n\nSo Bernstein Private Wealth's clients are high net worth individuals. How have you seen some of them react to the current market uncertainty?\n\nEven though that scenario, this market scenario was a really a tail risk event, it was still within our plans for what clients would expect. The market declines were not outside of the bounds of what we would have planned. And I think that's a very important point of view to come back to because people will say like, \"We never could have planned for this\" and the reality is in the market decline, we did actually plan for it. Of course, we didn't plan for a global pandemic with the economy shutting down overnight. But the market results that we so far are well within the plan. And so I think that's very reassuring for people. So in many cases we have clients that haven't changed their allocation advice. They, in fact, are now looking for opportunities to redeploy and opportunistic capital.\n\nWhat questions have your clients been asking in terms of what they should be doing right now, especially as the market's been changing?\n\nA month ago the key client question was, \"When's it going to stop? Am I going to be okay? How big is the decline going to be?\" And it was very intense. The speed of the market decline was incredibly intense. Again, the magnitude wasn't so intense, but the speed was.\n\nI would also say that the most frequently asked question a month ago was truly around the bond markets because while the equity market decline was well within norms, what happened to the bond market was far less expected. So even very high-quality municipal bonds saw declines that were pretty shocking to people. So I think the believing that that was going to restore to normalcy was really important. And of course the Fed action has been very helpful in that regard.\n\nSo I would say the key questions now are interesting. \"Why is the market up so much?\" Probably question one. In the sense of, \"What does the market see that I don't?\" Mixed in with, \"How do we get the economy back given where we are in jobless claims?\" And again, our lens is speaking to people that for the very most part are very fortunate, financially, in this setting. We're not speaking to people who are filing for unemployment claims right now, or at least I'm not aware of that. So the lens is very different, and I want to be sensitive in my response, that we recognize 20 percent of America right now is not working.\n\nBut the client questions that we're getting are, \"What's with the disconnect in the market going up versus the economic headlines and how I feel?\" And then, \"What does that mean for the back half of this year? Do we expect the markets to pivot again? Keep it downside? Or are we off to the races?\" And then, \"How do we fix this?\", \"Where does this go long-term?\", \"When's the vaccine?\" and \"How do we get out of it?\"\n\nHow do you advise them when they ask questions like that? Because those seem like difficult questions to answer.\n\nInvesting has always been about probabilities and forecasting in that best-case/base-case scenario along with worst-days is really ultimately more from which we've assessed those questions. And we assess those questions on individual companies as we do on the macro front and also as we do on the individual plan. So I think we start to go back to a framework from which we can understand that each question is different, but there is a case to be made that the market rally that we've seen is supported by the market looking past the health crisis and looking toward earnings. Not even this year, but in 2021. That's the case that you would make to support the rally.\n\nAnd of course the opposing case to that is that the back-to-work cycle will not look as even as people hope and that the virus could surge again in that return to open and we could have another national shutdown or something like that in mid-summer, late summer, and the fall. And that means a much choppier path. And so I think our current point of view is we're a little bit underweight global equities. But as the market has continued to go up, we've taken some risk off. And then in terms of individual stock selection, we continue to look for companies that we think have balance sheets and cash flow and revenue patterns that are sustainable.\n\nOn another note, I'm curious if there are any new struggles you've seen for women in order to achieve economic equality because of the pandemic now?\n\n[I read] an article that stated that female economists were having a harder time keeping up in this crisis versus male economists. So it caught my attention because of my focus on women in wealth. And effectively the article's data that, I guess they had looked at how much women had been publishing versus men in this time. And the answer was less. And I think weighted for the difference in numbers by gender. And I think the conclusion was for right or for wrong, whether it was anecdotal, was the exact same issue that I identified at the outset, that continues to be an issue, that it is harder to shift to managing a household and the kids without your normal infrastructure in place for childcare and becoming a homeschooling teacher while at the same time being all in for work.\n\nAnd so that one article did catch my eye and I thought that was interesting. I don't know that you can extrapolate, but I do think he second lens through which I view this is I'm on the board of a nonprofit called Women Employed. It's not affiliated with Bernstein, so I just want to caveat all of that. But that organization is focused on equality for women in the workplace and policies around paid sick leave and minimum wage and otherwise supporting equality across minorities, in particular, women.\n\nAnd I think their experience in terms of hearing from women on the front lines is of course hourly workers and workers in retail and in the restaurant business have really been disproportionately affected. And much of that population is women. The latest jobless claims numbers confirmed my suspicions, with the unemployment rate for women rising to 16 percent, compared to 13.5 percent for men, according to Labor Department data as of late April. Job losses in April were particularly steep among industries in which women account for more than half of all workers. So I think there may be the case that, again, if people are being furloughed and their paychecks are being replaced today, that works for now. It's just what happens when they come back? Will those jobs be replaced? And then again, if you're an hourly worker, what does that look like for you today compared to in the future? And I think there's potential for that gap to just widen.\n\nBernstein's slogan is \"make money meaningful.\" Our slogan here at Worth is \"worth beyond wealth,\" which is interesting because I think those two hit similar points. So I'd love to know how does one truly make money meaningful and, in particular, how can founders and entrepreneurs and business owners make money meaningful so as to achieve worth beyond wealth?\n\nWe've found, and I would say personally I found in particular with the women clients that I engage with, but this is really universal across gender, but a lot of times we've just found when people are saying in annual reviews, very large assets, they're saying, \"What's it all for?\" and \"What am I going to do with this?\" And the relative 1 percent plus or minus versus the benchmark is not that meaningful to them in comparison to seeing that money be put to use in a way that truly fulfills.\n\nAnd so we really work with families on exercises around value and mission statement and engagement across generations where we say, \"What would it take? How would you define success?\" before you start setting up a benchmark comparison for a portfolio or even a plan. I think sometimes it catches people off guard when we say, \"How would you define success?\" Because their answer starts sometimes with the financial metrics, but then ultimately evolves to, \"Look, I just want to see my kids grow up to be good humans with good values.\" And then we say, \"Well, what are those values?\" And then sometimes there's really an exercise around that value creation. And we found in some families that's very distinct and they already know what those values are. And in other situations we're really partnering with those families to help them uncover their values. And that's incredibly fulfilling because then it's the much bigger picture advice around very often it's about business transition questions, it's about intergenerational questions and it's about charitable intent. And so that's what we've found has really been that translation for making money meaningful.", "uri": "6076851950", "url": "https://www.worth.com/could-covid-19-set-economic-equality-back/"}], "p-6076374661": [191266394, {"sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "published_on": "2020-05-22T04:29:00Z", "name": "Closed-End Funds Advised by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC Announce Investment Policy ", "dtype": "pr", "pk": 191266394, "text": "Western Asset Intermediate Muni Fund Inc.\n\nWestern Asset Managed Municipals Fund Inc.\n\nWestern Asset Municipal Partners Fund Inc.\n\nWestern Asset Municipal High Income Fund Inc.\n\nWestern Asset Municipal Defined Opportunity Trust Inc.\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Western Asset Intermediate Muni Fund Inc.

Also effective today, MTT's current investment policy regarding TOB transactions is being updated to include the below disclosure.\n\nIn a TOB transaction, a Fund transfers securities (typically municipal bonds or other municipal securities) into a special purpose entity, referred to as a TOB trust. The TOB trust generally issues floating rate notes to third parties and residual interest TOBs to a Fund. The net proceeds of the sale of the floating rate notes, after expenses, are received by a Fund and may be invested in additional securities. The residual interest TOBs are inverse floating rate debt instruments (\"inverse floaters\"), as the return on those bonds is inversely related to changes in a specified interest rate. Distributions on the inverse floaters paid to a Fund will be reduced or, in the extreme, eliminated as short-term interest rates rise and will increase when such interest rates fall. Floating rate notes issued by a TOB trust may be senior to the inverse floaters held by a Fund. A Fund may enter into TOB transactions on either a non-recourse or recourse basis. If a Fund invests in a TOB trust on a recourse basis, it will bear the risk of loss with respect to any liquidation of the TOB trust. Each Fund will look through to the underlying securities held by a TOB trust for purposes of calculating compliance with the Fund's 80% policy, as described in each Fund's shareholder report. TOB transactions create leverage to the extent a Fund invests the net proceeds of the floating rate notes in additional securities. Each Fund currently intends to segregate or earmark liquid assets or otherwise cover its obligations with respect to its investments in TOB trusts.\n\nAn investment in a Fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Investment return and the value of shares will fluctuate. TOB transactions expose a Fund to leverage and credit risk, and generally involve greater risk than investments in fixed rate municipal bonds, including the risk of loss of principal. The interest payments that a Fund would typically receive on inverse floaters acquired in such transactions vary inversely with short-term interest rates and will be reduced (and potentially eliminated) when short-term interest rates increase. Inverse floaters will generally underperform the market for fixed rate municipal securities when interest rates rise. The value and market for inverse floaters can be volatile, and inverse floaters can have limited liquidity. Investments in inverse floaters issued in TOB transactions are derivative instruments and, therefore, are also subject to the risks generally applicable to investments in derivatives.\n\nThe Funds are closed-end management investment companies that are managed by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc., and are sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company, LLC, an affiliate of the investment manager.\n\nThis press release may contain statements regarding plans and expectations for the future that constitute forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

TOB transactions expose a Fund to leverage and credit risk, and generally involve greater risk than investments in fixed rate municipal bonds, including the risk of loss of principal. The interest payments that a Fund would typically receive on inverse floaters acquired in such transactions vary inversely with short-term interest rates and will be reduced (and potentially eliminated) when short-term interest rates increase. Inverse floaters will generally underperform the market for fixed rate municipal securities when interest rates rise. The value and market for inverse floaters can be volatile, and inverse floaters can have limited liquidity. Investments in inverse floaters issued in TOB transactions are derivative instruments and, therefore, are also subject to the risks generally applicable to investments in derivatives.\n\nThe Funds are closed-end management investment companies that are managed by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc., and are sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company, LLC, an affiliate of the investment manager.\n\nThis press release may contain statements regarding plans and expectations for the future that constitute forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Investors have plowed into highly rated corporate debt since the Federal Reserve pledged to intervene to keep credit flowing, setting off a rally amid confidence the market will weather the steep economic contraction.\n\nColleges have sold about $8 billion of bonds since mid-March, a steep increase from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That has included highly competitive schools such as Brown, Cornell, Duke, St. Louis's Washington and Harvard universities, all of which are seen as better able to contend with the pandemic's fallout than smaller colleges without such large endowments or cache.\n\nAbout half of borrowing has been done through the sale of corporate debt, which doesn't have the municipal-bond market's restrictions on how the funds can be spent.\n\n\"Taxable corporate bonds are appealing as they are experiencing historically low interest rates and the taxable bond market has had less volatility over the last month compared with the tax-exempt market,\" said Matt Greaves, the assistant vice president for treasury and finance at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nThe borrowing spree comes as the pandemic casts uncertainty over whether and how universities will resume classes in the fall. That's expected to increase the financial pressure on some private colleges that were already struggling with enrollment declines as debt-wary students seek less costly alternatives.\n\nYet even top-flight schools with large endowments and no trouble attracting students haven't been entirely unscathed. Harvard, the country's richest college, is forecasting a revenue shortfall of nearly $1.2 billion over two academic years. Northwestern was recently downgraded and is tapping its endowment and furloughing about 250 staff members. Cornell announced a hiring freeze and cut salaries for university leadership.\n\nEven so, Patrick Luby, a municipal-bond strategist at CreditSights Inc., said it's an \"opportune time\" for universities to raise money, especially in the taxable debt market where they pose far less risk than companies whose businesses are being battered by the slump.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology moved up to late April a $350 million debt sale for campus projects that wasn't slated to occur until as late as 2025, said Glen Shor, its vice president for finance. It paid yields of 2.29% on securities due in 2051.\n\n\"Favorable conditions for borrowing drove the Institute to accelerate its timeline,\" he said.\n\nColleges are one of the few types of borrowers that consistently swap between selling debt through the tax-exempt muni market and taxable corporate bond market. The taxable market is usually a quicker, though more expensive, avenue to sell bonds and doesn't carry the additional federal regulations that come with tax-exempt bonds.\n\nThe municipal market was roiled in March by concern about how badly the coronavirus will hammer the finances of governments and others, like hospitals or nursing homes, that have issued bonds. Though it has recovered, the gap has narrowed between the yields on top-rated municipal bonds and corporate debt, according to Bank of America Corp. analysts. That means the premium colleges have to pay to sell taxable is small.\n\nColleges and universities can also draw from a bigger buyer base when tapping the corporate market, said Nisha Patel, a portfolio manager at Parametric Portfolio Associates.\n\nCorporations have sold more than a $1 trillion of debt so far this year, far more than the $136 billion of long-term municipal bonds that have been issued. Moreover, the tax-exempt debt market is dominated by individual investors who tend to yank out their cash when they see losses pile up.\n\n\"Muni investors can be a little skittish about certain sectors,\" Patel said. \"Corporate buyers will be fine with higher rated institutions relative to the amount of risk in the corporate-bond market.\"", "uri": "6075878023", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/elite-colleges-join-bond-market-boom-by-seizing-on-low-rates"}], "6075662252": [335160532, {"sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "published_on": "2020-05-21T14:21:00Z", "name": "KORE Private Wealth Selects ICE Climate Risk, Strengthening Thought Leadership for Clients", "dtype": "news", "pk": 335160532, "text": "Adds to a rapidly growing number of municipal bond investors including climate risk in investment decisions\n\nBoston, Massachusetts--(Newsfile Corp. - May 21, 2020) - risQ Inc., a start-up delivering best-in-class climate risk analytics, and ICE Data Services, which is part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

Each Fund will look through to the underlying securities held by a TOB trust for purposes of calculating compliance with the Fund's 80% policy, as described in each Fund's shareholder report.

This makes these usually rock solid investments look riskier.\n\nHowever, while market fluctuations will continue and S&P's in-house economists say we are now in a recession, the effects of the pandemic and recession will vary depending on utility characteristics. Utilities with strong creditworthiness and proactive management will likely continue to have access to the muni bond market.\n\nFielding questions from S&P Global Ratings is Erin Boeke Burke (Associate Director, Municipal and Cooperative Utilities, S&P Global Ratings). Participating local governments include large municipalities like the City of Atlanta and the City of Philadelphia as well as smaller municipalities and water utilities, including the City of Garland (TX), Town of Amherst (MA) and Soquel Creek Water District (CA). The virtual event will take place May 27-28. It will be archived, keyword-tagged and searchable by local government officials & staff, ensuring that hundreds more local governments benefit from the candid discussion far into the future.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to have this unique opportunity to talk -- virtually -- with municipalities and utilities across the country.\" said Erin Boeke Burke, Associate Director, Municipal and Cooperative Utilities, S&P Global Ratings. \"S&P Global Ratings rates credit fundamentals, distinguishing between credit risk and headline risk. Our rating options are one of many tools available when making informed decisions, especially in the current environment.\"\n\n\"This is the moment to invest utility capital in water innovation, particularly onsite and decentralized water strategies,\" said Cynthia Koehler, Executive Director of WaterNow Alliance. \"From green stormwater infrastructure to water use efficiency measures to lead service line replacements -- these water infrastructure strategies do triple duty addressing key infrastructure needs, providing essential community benefits and critically, in this challenging economic moment, generating local jobs and stimulus. Capital markets are hungry for innovation and investors are willing and able to support water utilities taking this moment to embrace innovation that works for their communities.\"\n\n\"Local governments are currently undergoing a seismic shift due to the coronavirus crisis. While much remains uncertain, one trend is very clear: learning & sharing are moving online,\" said Ellory Monks, co-founder of The Atlas. \"We are proud to expand the free online resources available to local governments with these new virtual office hours, and we are excited to welcome S&P Global Ratings as our first guest. Social distancing cannot be allowed to stand in the way of local government learning -- the work of local government is far too essential and the stakes are far too high.\"\n\nAbout WaterNow Alliance\n\nWaterNow Alliance is a national network of local water utility decision makers supporting innovative, environmentally sustainable, climate resilient and affordable water strategies.\n\nAbout The Atlas\n\nThe Atlas is a free online community for local government officials & staff to browse city case studies, follow trending local government topics and post questions to colleagues. Since its launch in April 2019, The Atlas has grown from 0 to 2K+ monthly active city members. Its database includes more than 500 member-generated city case studies that cover topics as diverse as scooters, homelessness and green infrastructure.

Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\n\nPrincipal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may last for an extended period of time and will continue to impact the economy for the foreseeable future.\n\nAn Index ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index. You should anticipate that the value of an Index Fund's shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in the value of the index. An Index Fund's return may not match the return of the index. Unlike a Fund, the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a Fund.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nA Fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in a Fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in a Fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A Fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nInvestments in securities issued by companies operating in emerging market countries involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in securities and instruments issued by U.S. companies or by companies operating in other developed market countries. Investments in emerging markets securities are generally considered speculative in nature and are subject to the following heighted risks: smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity; significant price volatility; restrictions on foreign investment; possible repatriation of investment income and capital; rapid inflation; and currency convertibility issues. Emerging market countries also often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unsettled securities laws, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. For funds that track an index, the Index may not weight the securities in emerging market countries on the basis of investor protection limitations, financial reporting quality or available oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls, forced mergers, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure, nationalization or creation of government monopolies.\n\nInvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and/or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.\n\nPreferred securities, high-yield securities, corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and prepayment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income.\n\nSenior floating-rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. As a result, the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high-yield fixed income instruments. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and/or trading levels in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nIn the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan, which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the Fund's common shares. If the Fund acquires a senior loan from another lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.\n\nMany financial instruments use or may use a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is being phased out by the end of 2021. There remains some uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by a Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nConvertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and, as a result, are exposed to certain additional risks. The values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments, each with its own market value. A Fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument. Synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives.\n\nExchange-traded notes (ETNs) are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees. The value of an ETN may be influenced by various factors.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate operating companies (REOCs) are subject to certain risks, including changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates and competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (MLPs) are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that a MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when a Fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a Fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by a Fund.\n\nA Fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, an investment in a Fund may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an exchange-traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in-kind securities.\n\nA Fund's investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements.\n\nAlternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in other investment companies, including closed-end funds (CEFs), ETFs and affiliated ETFs, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nA Fund may invest in U.S. government obligations. U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nIncome from the First Trust Managed Municipal ETF (FMB), the First Trust California Municipal High Income ETF (FCAL), the First Trust Municipal High Income ETF (FMHI), the First Trust Short Duration Managed Municipal ETF (FSMB), and the First Trust Ultra Short Duration Municipal ETF (FUMB) may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax. FMB, FCAL, FMHI, FSMB, and FUMB may invest in zero coupon bonds which may be highly volatile as interest rates rise and fall. FCAL invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in California. Such concentration exposes the Fund to political, fiscal, and economic conditions affecting California municipal issuers and may affect the value of the Fund's investments.\n\nShort selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, a Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund or at prices approximately the value at which the Fund is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nCertain Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nNasdaq\u00ae and NASDAQ U.S. Multi-Asset Diversified Income IndexSM are registered trademarks and service marks of Nasdaq, Inc.

FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (\"FTP\"), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $127 billion as of April 30, 2020 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois.\n\nYou should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund before investing. Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\n\nPrincipal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may last for an extended period of time and will continue to impact the economy for the foreseeable future.\n\nAn Index ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index. You should anticipate that the value of an Index Fund's shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in the value of the index. An Index Fund's return may not match the return of the index. Unlike a Fund, the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a Fund.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nA Fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in a Fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in a Fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A Fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nInvestments in securities issued by companies operating in emerging market countries involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in securities and instruments issued by U.S. companies or by companies operating in other developed market countries. Investments in emerging markets securities are generally considered speculative in nature and are subject to the following heighted risks: smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity; significant price volatility; restrictions on foreign investment; possible repatriation of investment income and capital; rapid inflation; and currency convertibility issues. Emerging market countries also often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unsettled securities laws, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. For funds that track an index, the Index may not weight the securities in emerging market countries on the basis of investor protection limitations, financial reporting quality or available oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls, forced mergers, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure, nationalization or creation of government monopolies.\n\nInvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and/or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.\n\nPreferred securities, high-yield securities, corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and prepayment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income.\n\nSenior floating-rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. As a result, the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high-yield fixed income instruments. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and/or trading levels in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nIn the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan, which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the Fund's common shares. If the Fund acquires a senior loan from another lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.\n\nMany financial instruments use or may use a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is being phased out by the end of 2021. There remains some uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by a Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nConvertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and, as a result, are exposed to certain additional risks. The values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments, each with its own market value. A Fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument. Synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives.\n\nExchange-traded notes (ETNs) are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees. The value of an ETN may be influenced by various factors.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate operating companies (REOCs) are subject to certain risks, including changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates and competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (MLPs) are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that a MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when a Fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a Fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by a Fund.\n\nA Fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, an investment in a Fund may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an exchange-traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in-kind securities.\n\nA Fund's investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements.\n\nAlternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in other investment companies, including closed-end funds (CEFs), ETFs and affiliated ETFs, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nA Fund may invest in U.S. government obligations. U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nIncome from the First Trust Managed Municipal ETF (FMB), the First Trust California Municipal High Income ETF (FCAL), the First Trust Municipal High Income ETF (FMHI), the First Trust Short Duration Managed Municipal ETF (FSMB), and the First Trust Ultra Short Duration Municipal ETF (FUMB) may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax. FMB, FCAL, FMHI, FSMB, and FUMB may invest in zero coupon bonds which may be highly volatile as interest rates rise and fall. FCAL invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in California. Such concentration exposes the Fund to political, fiscal, and economic conditions affecting California municipal issuers and may affect the value of the Fund's investments.\n\nShort selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, a Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund or at prices approximately the value at which the Fund is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nCertain Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nNasdaq\u00ae and NASDAQ U.S. Multi-Asset Diversified Income IndexSM are registered trademarks and service marks of Nasdaq, Inc.

FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (\"FTP\"), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $127 billion as of April 30, 2020 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois.\n\nYou should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a Fund before investing. Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\n\nPrincipal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may last for an extended period of time and will continue to impact the economy for the foreseeable future.\n\nAn Index ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index. You should anticipate that the value of an Index Fund's shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in the value of the index. An Index Fund's return may not match the return of the index. Unlike a Fund, the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a Fund.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nA Fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in a Fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in a Fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A Fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nInvestments in securities issued by companies operating in emerging market countries involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in securities and instruments issued by U.S. companies or by companies operating in other developed market countries. Investments in emerging markets securities are generally considered speculative in nature and are subject to the following heighted risks: smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity; significant price volatility; restrictions on foreign investment; possible repatriation of investment income and capital; rapid inflation; and currency convertibility issues. Emerging market countries also often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unsettled securities laws, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. For funds that track an index, the Index may not weight the securities in emerging market countries on the basis of investor protection limitations, financial reporting quality or available oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls, forced mergers, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure, nationalization or creation of government monopolies.\n\nInvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and/or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.\n\nPreferred securities, high-yield securities, corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and prepayment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income.\n\nSenior floating-rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. As a result, the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high-yield fixed income instruments. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and/or trading levels in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nIn the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan, which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the Fund's common shares. If the Fund acquires a senior loan from another lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.\n\nMany financial instruments use or may use a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is being phased out by the end of 2021. There remains some uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by a Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nConvertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and, as a result, are exposed to certain additional risks. The values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments, each with its own market value. A Fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument. Synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives.\n\nExchange-traded notes (ETNs) are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees. The value of an ETN may be influenced by various factors.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate operating companies (REOCs) are subject to certain risks, including changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates and competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (MLPs) are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that a MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when a Fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a Fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by a Fund.\n\nA Fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, an investment in a Fund may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an exchange-traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in-kind securities.\n\nA Fund's investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements.\n\nAlternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in other investment companies, including closed-end funds (CEFs), ETFs and affiliated ETFs, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nA Fund may invest in U.S. government obligations. U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nIncome from the First Trust Managed Municipal ETF (FMB), the First Trust California Municipal High Income ETF (FCAL), the First Trust Municipal High Income ETF (FMHI), the First Trust Short Duration Managed Municipal ETF (FSMB), and the First Trust Ultra Short Duration Municipal ETF (FUMB) may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax. FMB, FCAL, FMHI, FSMB, and FUMB may invest in zero coupon bonds which may be highly volatile as interest rates rise and fall. FCAL invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in California. Such concentration exposes the Fund to political, fiscal, and economic conditions affecting California municipal issuers and may affect the value of the Fund's investments.\n\nShort selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, a Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund or at prices approximately the value at which the Fund is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nCertain Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nNasdaq\u00ae and NASDAQ U.S. Multi-Asset Diversified Income IndexSM are registered trademarks and service marks of Nasdaq, Inc.

I believe there is some cause for optimism for recovery in the municipal bond market. There may be many bumps in the road, but fears of many humpty-dumpty defaults really belong more in a story about Chicken Little.\n\nMy many years working with the municipal bond market entitles me, I suppose, to offer some perspective on what has occurred over the past two months, and what we might anticipate for the next few months. There isn't anyone who has not, in one way or another, asked \"What do I do next?\" To frame some possible answers, here are a few \"markers\" to consider.\n\nThese observations are, in and of themselves, touching important elements as to the restoration of economic and marketplace confidence. I cannot predict the path or duration of COVID-19, but it is certain to disrupt economic activity - everywhere. Its impact will be upon each entity that issues bonds for public improvements and purposes, to some greater or lesser degree. The bad news is that we cannot predict the impact everywhere. But the good news is that, owing to the structural requirements of bond financings in the municipal space, issues that carry ratings from Moody's, S&P and Fitch not only build reserves into each financing, but the ratings that are achieved are done so based, in part, upon the concept of \"rainy day\" reserves set aside by the issuer to meet contingencies such as what we are now witnessing.\n\nThe municipal industry has a long history of very strong credit quality and very low default experience. Though credit quality will be reviewed and tested in the months to come, these points will be important to note as investment decisions are made going forward:\n\nAll things considered, while we expect some bumpy roads in the near term, I am optimistic about the municipal bond market's recovery. The attributes that have historically contributed to the strength of this market are still there and may factor into its recovery.\n\nThis content is published in the United States for residents of specified countries.

The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may last for an extended period of time and will continue to impact the economy for the foreseeable future.\n\nAn Index ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index. You should anticipate that the value of an Index Fund's shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in the value of the index. An Index Fund's return may not match the return of the index. Unlike a Fund, the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a Fund.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nA Fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in a Fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in a Fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A Fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nInvestments in securities issued by companies operating in emerging market countries involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in securities and instruments issued by U.S. companies or by companies operating in other developed market countries. Investments in emerging markets securities are generally considered speculative in nature and are subject to the following heighted risks: smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity; significant price volatility; restrictions on foreign investment; possible repatriation of investment income and capital; rapid inflation; and currency convertibility issues. Emerging market countries also often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unsettled securities laws, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. For funds that track an index, the Index may not weight the securities in emerging market countries on the basis of investor protection limitations, financial reporting quality or available oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls, forced mergers, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure, nationalization or creation of government monopolies.\n\nInvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and/or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.\n\nPreferred securities, high-yield securities, corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and prepayment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income.\n\nSenior floating-rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. As a result, the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high-yield fixed income instruments. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and/or trading levels in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nIn the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan, which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the Fund's common shares. If the Fund acquires a senior loan from another lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.\n\nMany financial instruments use or may use a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is being phased out by the end of 2021. There remains some uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by a Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nConvertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and, as a result, are exposed to certain additional risks. The values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments, each with its own market value. A Fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument. Synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives.\n\nExchange-traded notes (ETNs) are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees. The value of an ETN may be influenced by various factors.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate operating companies (REOCs) are subject to certain risks, including changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates and competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (MLPs) are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that a MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when a Fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a Fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by a Fund.\n\nA Fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, an investment in a Fund may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an exchange-traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in-kind securities.\n\nA Fund's investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements.\n\nAlternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in other investment companies, including closed-end funds (CEFs), ETFs and affiliated ETFs, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nA Fund may invest in U.S. government obligations. U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nIncome from the First Trust Managed Municipal ETF (FMB), the First Trust California Municipal High Income ETF (FCAL), the First Trust Municipal High Income ETF (FMHI), the First Trust Short Duration Managed Municipal ETF (FSMB), and the First Trust Ultra Short Duration Municipal ETF (FUMB) may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax. FMB, FCAL, FMHI, FSMB, and FUMB may invest in zero coupon bonds which may be highly volatile as interest rates rise and fall. FCAL invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in California. Such concentration exposes the Fund to political, fiscal, and economic conditions affecting California municipal issuers and may affect the value of the Fund's investments.\n\nShort selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, a Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund or at prices approximately the value at which the Fund is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nCertain Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nNasdaq\u00ae and NASDAQ U.S. Multi-Asset Diversified Income IndexSM are registered trademarks and service marks of Nasdaq, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 369.04 points, or 1.5%, to 24575.90, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 190.67 points, or 2.1%, to 9375.78.\n\nThe gains were broad, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 in the green. The beaten-down energy group was the biggest gainer, rising 3.8% as crude oil rallied.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization companies, which tend to be sensitive to the domestic economy, gained 3%, outpacing the major large-cap indexes.\n\n\"If the economic reopenings are going well, or better than expected, on a consistent basis, the small caps will let us know,\" said Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank.\n\nStocks have rebounded sharply from their March lows, with the S&P 500 up 33% despite the blow the pandemic has dealt to the businesses and households and the uncertainty about the medical and economic path ahead.\n\n\"Valuations have accelerated quite quickly,\" said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. \"Our expectation is as news flow becomes available, that's probably going to drive a high degree of volatility going forward.\"\n\nAirline shares, which have been battered by the halt in global travel, popped, with United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines each up more than 4%. Airline executives have said bookings are picking up again, a potential inflection point for the industry.\n\nWednesday brought further news of potential progress in the race for a vaccine. Inovio Pharmaceuticals said its experimental coronavirus vaccine induced immune responses in mice and guinea pigs, according to a new study published in Nature Communications. Researchers from the biotechnology company and its academic collaborators said the data were encouraging but more testing is needed in animals and humans. Shares jumped $1.23, or 8.4%, to $15.79.\n\nThe Inovio news came two days after drugmaker Moderna said the first human study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine showed promise in some of the healthy volunteers who were vaccinated. That report helped send stocks surging Monday.\n\nMany investors expect to continue seeing big market reactions as news trickles in about the success of business openings and the race to develop treatments and vaccines.\n\n\"What's key is how we open up this economy going into the fall and whether or not the opening of the U.S. economy induces a coronavirus surge,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"We remain at the mercy of the virus.\"\n\nInvestors carefully watching the Federal Reserve for signs of future monetary policy got their first opportunity Wednesday to parse the minutes of the central bank's April 28-29 policy meeting.

Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest earnings reports from retailers continued to be a mixed bag. Home-improvement retailer Lowe's beat analysts' estimates with a higher quarterly profit as online sales grew during the pandemic.

What makes COVID-19 different for our political future is that we have chosen to almost completely shut down the economy to minimize casualties.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been vilified for initially dismissing the threat as the virus spread from China, but he had help. Well after China was taking aggressive action in Wuhan, Nancy Pelosi was shaking hands, encouraging visits to San Francisco's Chinatown and criticizing Trump's travel ban on China.\n\nOn March 2, New York Governor Cuomo stated, \"We don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries.\" Shortly thereafter, the seat of global capitalism became the epicenter of the pandemic.\n\nThis is not to let Trump off the hook, but it illustrates that partisanship and the upcoming election blur the vision of responsible leaders in both political parties. That makes the loss of life and economic fallout much worse.\n\nWhen it's all over, China likely will have emerged quicker and with its economy more intact -- that will impress the minds of young voters.\n\nEven before the COVID-19, socialism was attracting the sympathies of millennials, and now they have been riveted by two great traumas -- the financial crisis and the coronavirus shutdown -- that profoundly impair their financial stability, ability to purchase homes and raise families.\n\nLiving with the burdens of elders' broken promises -- stints at college that bequeathed burdensome debt, too few decent career opportunities and an Affordable Care Act that further monopolizes health care without making it affordable -- the current crisis will make them even more skeptical about politics in Washington. And prey for pied pipers of socialism like Bernie Sanders or Trojan horses like the Green New Deal.\n\nCapitalism is a Darwinian system. Recessions cull firms with weak business models and in declining markets. In good times, firms like J.C. Penny and Neiman Marcus borrow cheaply and when the inevitable next downturn follows, debt burdens drive them to Chapter 11, downsizing and even closure.\n\nWith unemployment heading to 20% and the economy vulnerable to a permanent malaise, the Federal Reserve has embraced radical interventions that may ensure some kind of recovery but will also slow future growth and exacerbate inequality.\n\nThe Fed is going around the banks and other financial institution it regulates to directly purchase corporate, state and municipal bonds, and it is opening direct lending windows to corporations and small businesses.\n\nShould the Fed, as some suggest, start purchasing stocks in publicly traded companies, Chairman Jerome Powell will have a state bank unrivaled in its reach by any socialist or communist enterprise in the world.\n\nThe Fed being a remote institution is in a much better position to assess the prospects for repayment by large businesses -- with established credit ratings, analysts that follow their prospects and markets that grade their likelihood of default -- than for small businesses.\n\nThe Fed's lending programs cannot help but rescue more precarious large corporations than equally challenged mom and pop operations -- as least as measured by total capital deployed and sales.\n\nThe added concentration of economic power that follows will further elevate labor markets and wages of those with the skills to prosper from the growth of big enterprises from those stuck in service activities like restaurants and the gig economy.\n\nStock and bond markets and private investors recognize that crises change consumer behavior and offer less support in recessions to industries with falling prospects.\n\nCrowded dining rooms, daily briefings and group visits to attractions on shore may make cruise ships petri dishes for COVID-19 but also for flus, colds and other communicable diseases. Cruising will become more expensive as operators seek to better space people and attract fewer customers, but the Fed threw Carnival and other operators a lifeline through intervention in corporate bond markets.\n\nThat retards the redeployment of capital to better uses and will repeat in other industries. The economy will not attain its former size quickly. GDP growth will hunker down to about 2% or less and average wages will remain anemic.\n\nAll of that will further impair the dreams of young Americans and as the demographic footprint of baby boomers recedes, Bernie Sanders' successors will find a more receptive audience for democratic socialism.\n\nModerates in both political parties better find a way to better get along and start coming up with answers.", "uri": "6074815171", "url": "https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/5/20/21265042/covid-19-socialism-millennials-capitalism-economic-decline"}], "6074777088": [294008187, {"sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "published_on": "2020-05-20T21:25:00Z", "name": "U.S. Stocks Advance on Recovery Hopes  --  Update", "dtype": "news", "pk": 294008187, "text": "U.S. stocks rose Wednesday on optimism about the prospects for economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAll 50 states have relaxed some of their coronavirus restrictions as officials seek to revive economies battered by the pandemic, and investors are continuing to focus on any sign of hope for a vaccine.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 48.67 points, or 1.7%, to 2971.61, closing at its highest level since early March.

Prospectuses for the Funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll-free at 1-800-621-1675 or visiting www.ftportfolios.com. A prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\n\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in a Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\n\nPrincipal Risk Factors: A Fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. There can be no assurance that a Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges. The risks of investing in each Fund are spelled out in its prospectus, shareholder report, and other regulatory filings.\n\nSecurities held by a fund, as well as shares of a fund itself, are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors such as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result of the risk of loss associated with these market fluctuations. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. The outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as COVID-19 in December 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets, which have caused losses for investors. The impact of this COVID-19 pandemic may last for an extended period of time and will continue to impact the economy for the foreseeable future.\n\nAn Index ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index. You should anticipate that the value of an Index Fund's shares will decline, more or less, in correlation with any decline in the value of the index. An Index Fund's return may not match the return of the index. Unlike a Fund, the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a Fund.\n\nInvestors buying or selling Fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Investors who sell Fund shares may receive less than the share's net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the Fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the Fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may trade at a discount to the Fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.\n\nOne of the principal risks of investing in a Fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a Fund, Fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.\n\nAn actively managed ETF is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing such a Fund's investment portfolio, the portfolio managers, management teams, advisor or sub-advisor, will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result.\n\nA Fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks, including limited diversification. An investment in a Fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a Fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in small capitalization and mid-capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.\n\nAn investment in a Fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. A Fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.\n\nInvestments in securities issued by companies operating in emerging market countries involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in securities and instruments issued by U.S. companies or by companies operating in other developed market countries. Investments in emerging markets securities are generally considered speculative in nature and are subject to the following heighted risks: smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity; significant price volatility; restrictions on foreign investment; possible repatriation of investment income and capital; rapid inflation; and currency convertibility issues. Emerging market countries also often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, unsettled securities laws, unreliable securities valuation and greater risk associated with custody of securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. For funds that track an index, the Index may not weight the securities in emerging market countries on the basis of investor protection limitations, financial reporting quality or available oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls, forced mergers, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, seizure, nationalization or creation of government monopolies.\n\nInvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and/or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.\n\nPreferred securities, high-yield securities, corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and prepayment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for floating-rate loans and high-yield securities. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by a Fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from a Fund's fixed-income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed-income securities in a Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in a Fund's income.\n\nSenior floating-rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. As a result, the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high-yield fixed income instruments. High-yield securities, or \"junk\" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.\n\nThe senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and/or trading levels in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions.\n\nIn the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan, which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the Fund's common shares. If the Fund acquires a senior loan from another lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.\n\nMany financial instruments use or may use a floating rate based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is being phased out by the end of 2021. There remains some uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate.\n\nIncome from municipal bonds held by a Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.\n\nConvertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and, as a result, are exposed to certain additional risks. The values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments, each with its own market value. A Fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument. Synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives.\n\nExchange-traded notes (ETNs) are senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees. The value of an ETN may be influenced by various factors.\n\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate operating companies (REOCs) are subject to certain risks, including changes in the real estate market, vacancy rates and competition, volatile interest rates and economic recession.\n\nMaster limited partnerships (MLPs) are subject to certain risks, including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics, energy conservation, taxes, price controls, and other regulatory policies of various governments. In addition, there is the risk that a MLP could be taxed as a corporation, resulting in decreased returns from such MLP.\n\nThe use of futures, options, and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when a Fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a Fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by a Fund.\n\nA Fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, an investment in a Fund may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an exchange-traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in-kind securities.\n\nA Fund's investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements.\n\nAlternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in other investment companies, including closed-end funds (CEFs), ETFs and affiliated ETFs, which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds. In addition, a Fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds.\n\nA Fund may invest in U.S. government obligations. U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nIncome from the First Trust Managed Municipal ETF (FMB), the First Trust California Municipal High Income ETF (FCAL), the First Trust Municipal High Income ETF (FMHI), the First Trust Short Duration Managed Municipal ETF (FSMB), and the First Trust Ultra Short Duration Municipal ETF (FUMB) may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax. FMB, FCAL, FMHI, FSMB, and FUMB may invest in zero coupon bonds which may be highly volatile as interest rates rise and fall. FCAL invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in California. Such concentration exposes the Fund to political, fiscal, and economic conditions affecting California municipal issuers and may affect the value of the Fund's investments.\n\nShort selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, a Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy.\n\nCertain Funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund or at prices approximately the value at which the Fund is carrying the securities on its books.\n\nCertain Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.\n\nNasdaq and NASDAQ U.S. Multi-Asset Diversified Income Index are registered trademarks and service marks of Nasdaq, Inc.

Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals jumped 11% after its experimental coronavirus vaccine induced immune responses in mice and guinea pigs, according to a new study published in Nature Communications. Researchers from the biotechnology company and its academic collaborators said the data were encouraging but more testing is needed in animals and humans.\n\nThe Inovio news came two days after drugmaker Moderna said the first human study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine showed promise in some of the healthy volunteers who were vaccinated.

Some of the safest debt, such as municipal bonds, are now causing its issuers to ask for help from the Federal Reserve amid the coronavirus outbreak, and it looks like their pleas will be answered.\n\nSince muni bond interest is exempt from federal taxes, muni ETFs are a good way for investors seeking tax-exempt income, especially those in higher tax brackets. Due to its tax-exempt status, the asset category is also best utilized in taxable accounts. Current risk trends indicate it could be time to consider MAAX.\n\n\"The good news is that owing to the structural requirements of bond financings in the municipal space, issues that carry ratings from Moody's, S&P and Fitch not only build reserves into each financing, but the ratings that are achieved are done so based, in part, upon the concept of 'rainy day' reserves set aside by the issuer to meet contingencies such as what we are now witnessing,\" said Colby.\n\nMunicipal bonds, also known simply as munis, are debt obligations issued by government entities. Like other forms of debt, when you purchase a municipal bond, you are loaning money to the issuer in exchange for a set number of interest payments over a predetermined period of time.

He's been overweight fixed-income assets since late 2014, and he's maintaining that stance today.\n\n\"We actually believe that US equities are about 35% overvalued today,\" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview. \"While the yields are low in fixed income, whether taxable or not, they have the nice property of being more defensive.\"\n\nIn his view, the rally in stocks over the last two months doesn't reflect the economic wreckage caused by the coronavirus pandemic and accompanying lockdowns, or the enormous debts governments are taking on as they try to rescue their economies. He says the concentration in tech stocks like Microsoft and Amazon is also a warning sign.\n\nWith that in mind, Allen says the most important thing an investor can do today is get their asset allocation right. And it's just as important to be patient and not overreact to the latest developments.\n\n\"The thing that really, really hurts investors, is number one, trying to market time and then number two, investing based on what's just happened,\" he said.\n\nWhile Allen thinks the next few years are going to be good ones for active management, he says it's possible to create a very effective and safe portfolio for the next few years using just a handful exchange-traded funds, and thinks this type of design will thrive for the next few years with only periodic rebalancing.\n\nAllen thinks the market is shaping up to perform like it did in the disappointing 2000s, a long stretch where major indexes were essentially flat after multiple recessions. He's projecting an annual return of about 2% for the S&P 500 over the next seven years, compared to about 8% for emerging markets stocks.\n\nHe also thinks growth stock indexes like the Russell\n\n\"We're underweight equities relative to fixed income and alternatives,\" he said. \"Within equities, we are overweight value relative to growth (and) international versus US.\"\n\nOut of that 50%, he recommends a 15% allocation to a minimum-volatility fund like the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol Global ETF, 20% in a quality stock ETF like the iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, and 15% in a broad global ETF like the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF.\n\nWhile bond yields are historically low, Allen thinks the returns on tax-free bonds will be about the same as US stocks over the next few years. Meanwhile bonds are more defensive.\n\n\"We've been leaning into municipal bonds, and taxable bonds because of their yield, and their protected downside risk,\" Allen said. \"Fixed income ... tends to do well when equities are expensive, so you basically avoid a lot of the volatility, market timing, and the panic that occurs with that, and you can get a more stable return pattern. \"\n\nHe says a fund like the iShares National Muni Bond ETF would work well for this purpose.\n\nBased on his concerns about stock valuations, Allen has designed this as a 50-50 portfolio, half stocks and half fixed income and alternatives, as an alternative to the traditional 60% stock-40% bond portfolio. That means a larger chunk of this portfolio is made up of assets that aren't correlated to stocks and won't just rise and fall as they do.\n\nHe says his alternative ETF strategy would include a 10% allocation to the iShares Gold Trust, a fund that owns physical gold; 10% in the IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Tracker ETF, which tracks the performance of hedge funds, and 10% to the iShares Core Moderate Allocation ETF, which replicates funds that target a moderate level of risk.", "uri": "6074274463", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-strategy-build-perfect-portfolio-asset-allocation-recommendations-7-etfs-2020-5"}], "6074053461": [263279673, {"sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "published_on": "2020-05-20T09:32:00Z", "name": "Investors Are Worried About Muni Bonds.

Does that present a warning -- or an opportunity -- for investors?\n\nWith top-grade munis offering higher after-tax yields than corporate junk bonds, the answer would appear to be the latter.\n\nState and local government borrowers haven't gotten the same benefit as corporations from the Federal Reserve, as my colleague Alexandra Scaggs explains. Investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds have rallied strongly in response to the Fed's backup, while munis have provided relatively paltry returns.\n\nFed Support for Municipalities Won't Come Cheap Stock Futures Are Rising 14 Charts to Track the Recovery\n\nStates and localities have seen their budget deficits soar from the effects of the coronavirus crisis, which has decimated their tax revenues while sharply boosting their spending needs. This sharp deterioration in their current spending is separate from the pension problems faced by many even though the two financial problems often are conflated.\n\nNatalie Cohen, a veteran muni analyst who now publishes the Public Purse blog, estimates the coronavirus outbreak could cost $200 billion in revenue shortfalls for states. Counties could face $114 billion in lost revenues and $30 billion in additional expenditures, she adds. New York state, at the center of the Covid-19 crisis, faces a $14 billion deficit while its pension plan is almost fully funded, the second-best state in the nation.\n\nThese two factors have been reflected in the extraordinary cheapness, in bond market parlance, of munis. That is, their yields are sharply higher than normal.\n\n\"This asset class is either the most mispriced sector of the market, or it is an omen of impending doom,\" Harley Bassman writes in an email promoting his latest Convexity Maven blog.\n\nThe latter possibility is reflected in the extraordinary premium on top-quality, triple-A-rated 30-year municipal bonds, which offered a 1.95% federally tax-free yield, compared with a 1.35% on a 30-year Treasury bond. That's a spread of 60 basis points, compared with a 10-year average spread of eight basis points, he noted. (A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point.) By contrast, investment-grade corporate and agency mortgage-backed spreads have returned close to their decade averages since the Fed announced its aggressive measures to support the credit markets in March.\n\nBassman, who formerly led Merrill Lynch's mortgage and derivatives desk and created the MOVE Index -- the volatility gauge for bonds analogous to the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, for stocks -- found a number of top-grade munis that offer significantly higher after-tax yields than marquee-name corporates.\n\nFor instance, Georgia's AAA-rated 4% general obligation bonds, due July 1, 2035, and callable July 1, 2028, are priced to yield 1.51% -- trading roughly flat to Apple's (ticker: AAPL) 30-year bonds on a taxable-equivalent basis (2.40% for an investor in the top 37% tax bracket). The Georgia bonds trade at a significant premium, and the yield assumes they will be called away from the investor (as with other bonds cited here).\n\n\"While it is a near certainty that Georgia will pay off its obligations (just raise taxes), the same cannot be said about Apple. Recall that Motorola, Nokia, BlackBerry at one point also offered a 'must have' phone,\" Bassman observes.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up This Week's Magazine\n\nThis weekly email offers a full list of stories and other features in this week's magazine. Saturday mornings ET.\n\nPREVIEWSUBSCRIBE\n\nHe offers several other examples of high-grade muni bonds from states whose pensions are roughly 80% funded and have relatively ample amounts outstanding:\n\nCincinnati, Ohio, Water System 4% revenue bonds, due Dec. 1, 2037, and callable Dec. 1, 2029, to yield 1.91%; and Florida Board of Education 3% bonds due June 1, 2018, and callable June 1, 2027, to yield 1.37%.\n\nCalifornia's general obligation bonds are rated AA-minus, three notches below the top grade; its 4% GOs, due Oct. 1, 2044, and callable Oct. 1, 2029, yield 2.38%, which is equivalent to 5.19% for a Golden State resident paying the top combined tax rate of 54.10%, according to Eaton Vance's handy taxable-equivalent yield calculator.\n\nFinally, New York City Transitional Finance Authority 3.625% bonds, rated Aaa by Moody's and AA-plus by Standard & Poor's, due Feb. 1, 2045, and callable Feb. 1, 2027, yield 2.89%, equivalent to 6.21% for a New York City resident at the top 53.50% tax bite. That tops the 5.46% yield on the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond exchange-traded fund (HYG).\n\nSafety as well as yield are key considerations for muni investors. Among the state issuers, UBS listed Washington, Wisconsin, Florida, Virginia, and Utah as \"resilient credits\" in a recent research note. Topping the \"vulnerable credits\" was Illinois, with New Jersey at No. 3, both with well-known deep pension woes. The second-most vulnerable state credit, according to UBS, was Kentucky, whence hails Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who recently suggested bankruptcy was a route for financially strapped states to consider rather than looking to Washington for help, although he subsequently backed off from that idea.\n\nOpting for a fund provides diversification and professional management to deal with risks while still gaining a yield advantage. Using Vanguard's no-load funds as an example, its Long-Term Tax-Exempt fund (VWLTX) shows a 30-day yield of 2.27%, equivalent to a 3.34% yield on a taxable fund for somebody in the 32% federal bracket, compared with 2.70% for its Long-Term Investment-Grade taxable fund (VWESX).\n\nHigher tax-free yields are available from closed-end funds, which took a beating in the steep stock and bond market plunge in March but have only partially recovered since. Among muni CEFs featured in Barron's recently, BlackRock Municipal 2030 Target Term (BTT) yields 3.32% (4.88% taxable equivalent in the 32% bracket) and trades at an 8.32% discount from its net asset value; it is scheduled to liquidate and return capital on that date, analogous to a bond.\n\nAmong the largest muni CEFs is Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Muni Income (NEA), which yields 5.10% (7.50% taxable equivalent in the 32% bracket) and trades at a 9.95% discount. That's even cheaper than in March, a laggard performance that reflects the worries besetting the muni market.\n\nWrite to Randall W.

But state and local governments have to wait longer -- and clear arguably higher hurdles -- to access central-bank financing.\n\nThe disparity has already had consequences for bond markets. And it could continue to weigh down municipal bonds' performance relative to corporate bonds.\n\nIn Tuesday testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the municipal liquidity facility should be fully operational by the end of this month. Before they can apply to borrow from the Fed, municipalities must first file a \"Notice of Interest\" with the central bank, and the New York Fed posted the materials necessary to send such a notice last week.\n\nBut corporate bonds are already getting a boost: Last Tuesday, the New York Fed started buying exchange-traded funds that own corporate bonds. And \"in the near future\" the Fed says it will begin buying corporate bonds, both directly from companies and from banks trading bonds in secondary markets.\n\nThe investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond markets have responded to the intervention already. Each has gained more than 10% since March 23, when the Fed announced its plan to buy corporate bonds, according to ICE BofA Indices.\n\nMunicipal bonds' gains have been muted in comparison. Since the Fed announced its facility to buy municipal bonds, the broad market has returned less than 1%, according to ICE BofA Indices.\n\nWhat's more, volatility has jumped in the largest ETF tracking muni-bond markets, the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB). Bank of America says that is because Fed intervention has dampened volatility in corporate bonds. The muni ETF now has higher relative volatility than the largest ETFs tracking emerging-market bonds (EMB), investment-grade corporate bonds (LQD) and high-yield corporate bonds (HYG). It used to have the lowest relative volatility of the bunch.\n\nCentral bank aid is important for muni bond markets for much larger reasons than ETF volatility. If experts are correct, state and local governments are going to need as much help with funding as they can get. Many were under stress even before the coronavirus pandemic spread to the U.S., thanks to unfunded pension liabilities and budget fights.\n\n\"COVID-19 now poses the most severe challenge to municipal credit in living memory,\" wrote Thomas McLoughlin at UBS Global Wealth Management. \"While the incidence of fiscal distress is rising, the real test will come next year when budget cuts will dominate the headlines.\"\n\nFor now, Illinois, a poster child for stretched state budgets, is paying up to raise cash in capital markets. The state issued $800 million of bonds last week, and will pay coupons of 4.88% to 5.75% on those bonds, according to Bloomberg. The bonds were sold with spreads almost a full percentage point wider than typical munis with comparable (or slightly higher) ratings. Illinois is rated BBB-, one tier above junk.\n\nNotably, investors were originally discussing yields of 7% to 7.5% for Illinois, according to Citigroup, a price that would have been unusually high even for a junk-rated issuer.\n\nStates and municipalities that get downgraded from investment grade to junk in the coming weeks and months will still be able to access the Fed's facility. Companies will also be able to borrow even if they are downgraded from investment grade to junk and become so-called \"fallen angels.\"\n\nThat means Illinois will qualify for the Fed's liquidity facility even if it is downgraded. But that doesn't mean the state would get much of a break on pricing.\n\nAccording to a pricing schedule released by the central bank early this week, municipalities at the lowest tier of investment grade will need to pay 3.8 percentage points above benchmark rates to borrow from the Fed. Those that get downgraded to junk will need to pay 5.9 percentage points above benchmark rates. (To compare, this week Illinois paid a roughly 4.8-percentage-point spread to sell its bonds.)\n\nIn an explainer, also published this week, the Fed said \"the interest rate on [muni] notes must be a penalty rate, meaning a rate that is a premium to the market rate in normal circumstances, affords liquidity in unusual and exigent circumstances, and encourages repayment of the Eligible Notes and discourages use of the Facility as the unusual and exigent circumstances that motivated the program recede and economic conditions normalize.\"\n\nNo such language exists in the frequently asked question section for the central bank's corporate-bond-buying facilities.\n\nTo be sure, companies aren't exactly borrowing for free. They will need to pay a one-time fee of 1 percentage point, according to the details of the Fed's program.\n\nEven so, municipalities will need to pay above-market costs regularly in interest payments. And they still will need to pay a one-time fee of 0.1 percentage point to use the facility.\n\nAnd when it comes to broader junk-bond markets, the Fed will probably lend more support to low-rated companies than risky municipal borrowers. That is because the central bank can buy high-yield corporate bond ETFs, and can't buy any muni ETFs at all, much less high-yield ones.\n\n\"The unprecedented monetary and fiscal support for the economy will allow most municipal bond issuers to recover but the high yield sector is particularly exposed,\" wrote UBS's McLoughlin.\n\nThe central bank may be less proactive in the muni market than it is in the corporate bond market because it wants to defer to elected officials in Washington. But McLoughlin and his team raised questions about whether a divided Congress will be able to successfully direct sufficient aid to cities and states. The House passed another stimulus bill this past Friday, but it isn't likely to become law in its current form.\n\n\"The Senate appears more reluctant to write a blank check to states and local governments and is likely to demand the inclusion of provisions to shield businesses and health care providers from coronavirus claims,\" McLoughlin and his team wrote. \"Enactment of the next round of legislation is likely to be more challenging than the first four.\"\n\nWrite to Alexandra Scaggs at alexandra.scaggs@barrons.com", "uri": "6074026292", "url": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/cities-and-states-to-need-federal-reserve-help-what-that-means-for-municipal-bonds-51589965200"}], "6073790935": [443288945, {"sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "published_on": "2020-05-20T04:37:00Z", "name": "India to allow funds more exposure to government bonds", "dtype": "news", "pk": 443288945, "text": "Mumbai: India's capital market regulator has allowed some categories of debt mutual funds to invest more in government bonds and treasury bills.\n\nCorporate bond funds, banking & PSU funds and credit risk funds can invest an additional 15% of their assets in sovereign bonds or treasury bills, according to a letter from the Securities and Exchange Board of India seen by Bloomberg News.

The Covid-19 pandemic has already compelled a spate of municipal bond defaults and at least one bankruptcy. More are coming. Don't say you weren't forewarned.\n\nHowever, forewarned is forearmed. If you find yourself face to face with a municipal bond workout, here are several factors to keep in mind.\n\nAvoid a Bankruptcy Filing\n\nHaving gone through three bankruptcies, including testifying in Federal Bankruptcy Court, I draw on these experiences to offer this to counsel borrowers and investors: avoid the bankruptcy option. Either Chapter 9 for municipalities or Chapter 11 for private entities (including nonprofits), bankruptcy is time consuming, expensive for all parties involved, often creates polarization when you need cooperation and the results are usually not much better than had something been negotiated between the stakeholders. This is particularly true for Chapter 9 filings, where the case law is not well defined. You definitely don't want to be on the wrong end of setting precedent. (Read What 'Adult Entertainment,' Puerto Rico and Chapter 9 Bankruptcy Have In Common for a well-detailed breakdown of the issues in Chapter 9 filings.)\n\nThe Upside: If you absolutely cannot find any other alternative than a bankruptcy filing, strive to go to court with a \"Pre-pack\" in hand. A pre-pack is a bankruptcy where all the issues are resolved and the path forward is clear. All you need is the judge's gavel for approval.\n\nThe Snarling Attorney\n\nIn some workouts, borrowers opt to go the belligerent route. They retain a firm of litigious counsel -- \"lawyering-up,\" as the phrase goes. Usually this is initiated by either a management with something to hide (trying to coat either ineptitude or malfeasance -- or both -- with a \"strong-offense-is-good-defense\" strategy), or an attorney or someone on the Board who just read Barbarians At The Gate or watches too much Shark Tank and now wants to prove they can play the hard-nosed Wall Street game.\n\nI've faced a few of these. It wastes a lot of time, money and energy that otherwise might be used productively. Plus, it never works. But in a default, you're not getting people at their best. Emotions run high, the impulse to fight overwhelms reason. So, you have to deal with it.\n\nFaced with a borrower bringing this strategy, investors might quickly find the borrower using the essentiality of their purpose as leverage to try to drive a hard bargain. Bondholders risk being portrayed as greedy Wall Streeters trying to extract their pound of flesh from a poor distressed nonprofit. Because of the demographics they serve, borrowers might also bring political pressure to bear as well. Knowing that well-known institutions generally don't want their brand and reputation besmirched, borrowers try to gain an upper negotiating hand by leveraging press and politics.\n\nThe Upside: Of course, bondholders are not without recourse. Counter threats of forensic audits and suits against boards of directors for negligence in oversight have been know to level the playing field. Mud-raking and accusations of wrongdoing can go both ways. Institutions may briefly lose a little reputational luster; individuals can lose homes, savings and livelihoods. But that usually only drags out the misery and, while bringing some short-term emotional satisfaction, does not generate much economic satisfaction.\n\nBondholders are urged to keep in mind that they have another option a borrower does not: selling the bonds to a vulture fund. Yes, the vulture fund is going to pay a pennies-on-the-dollar-bottom-basement price. But ridding one's self of the aggravation of protracted dealings with a hostile and intransigent borrower may be worth the cost.\n\nThe borrower would be wise to keep this in mind as well, carefully weighed before entering into any hostile strategy. A large, well-respected financial firm has the ability and resources to compromise to find a best outcome for all stakeholders. On the other hand, a vulture fund generally doesn't care about borrowers' essential purposes or services. They don't care if they are dragged through the mud, having been down this road many times. All they want is profit. They know how to give twice as hard as they get and have no compunction about putting the borrower's reputation at risk. After all, the borrower is in default. They are already on shaky ground to start throwing stones. To mix metaphors.\n\nEssential Services\n\nProject financings for hospitals, senior care, senior living projects and public works utilities are generally attractive to investors because they are, or are perceived to be, more secure because they provide essential services to their community. They are \"too essential to fail.\"\n\nBut that becomes a double-edged sword in a workout. The fundamental economics of a single-purpose project can be an impediment. Essentiality of purpose can mean an inelasticity in demand for its services. The community (defined either geography, demographics or by services required) still needs the services being provided, be they healthcare or public utility. Water needs to flow, waste needs to be processed, electricity needs to be generated, patients need care. Since operations have to be kept open, even if at a minimum, that means limited budget flexibility. The only place for big savings may be in debt service, either reduced or deferred.\n\nThe Upside: The good news for bondholders is that essentiality of services still presents an economic safety net. The financial issues bedeviling the borrower may be temporary (even if the temporary time frame is counted in years). A resolution taking a long view (and why not, since the bondholder isn't getting paid in the interim anyway) can usually be found and with higher recovery.\n\nFixed Assets\n\nSitting at the table of one workout I was involved in, a simple solution emerged -- well, at least in my head: put the overbuilt project on wheels and roll it down the road to a better and bigger market. But alas, the facility wasn't on wheels. It was a very fixed asset. This highlights two problems bondholders and borrowers alike face with a fixed asset -- immobility and illiquidity.\n\nMost of the time, as much as you wish you could move a project, you just can't. Moreover, it's not just fixed in place. It's fixed in size. When a project is just too big for the market, it can be hard to shrink. An overbuilt Continuing Care Retirement Center or for-profit student housing can close wings or floors, but it rarely can be made physically smaller. There is no shrinkage. A special purpose or special design facility -- think proton therapy projects -- are bound equally by location and purpose. The fixed nature of the asset also defines its budget to large degree. Empty units still need to be heated and cooled, physical plant maintained.\n\nThe immobility, special purpose, and fixed size also limits liquidity. There are business brokers for CCRCs and college campuses (if supply and demand exist, a business will emerge to fill the niche) but there are limited buyers, particularly if the project hasn't worked. Often the appraised value goes to land values, since discounting going concern cash-flows evaluations don't work when there is no going concern and no cash-flow. Bondholders valued their bonds based on payments from operating businesses, not underlying real estate. Discovering the underlying real estate value is usually much lower than from a going-concern value is a bitter pill.\n\nThe Upside: In some cases, particularly in senior living or housing, there may be some renovation or remodeling to create fewer units, units sized better for the marketplace, or units repurposed for other types of revenue producing services. The price charged per unit, although the unit is physically larger, may still remain unchanged -- or have to be decreased -- to attract residents. Additionally, what is single purpose in one community might be an addition to a national or regional business looking to expand. A better brand name on the entrance sign could both improve reputation immediately as well offer greater resources, both for services and management. Plus, foreclosure might be avoided -- always a thorny issue as to responsibility and liability. None of these options are simple, but for bondholders, finding a solution generating some cash flow is better than no cash flow.\n\nTax-Exempt Financing\n\nLaden with regulations and restrictions, mostly from the U.S. tax code governing the \"use of proceeds\" of tax-exempt debt, options are considerably limited when it comes to a workout. Original maturities can't be extended, a new debt structure might fall under reissuance rules, and the bonds can't be advance refunded. Moreover, all the capital sources at table are debt. Unlike seemingly endless permutations of equity structures, debt can only be parsed only so many ways.\n\nThe Upside: While tax-exempt bond rules block a lot of workout exits, the market acceptance of taxable debt (free from code restrictions) offers considerable wiggle room. Additionally, senior debt that is in default under the existing cash flow might offer some payment if bifurcated into a senior-subordinate security structure. Even though capital options are restricted to debt in one form or another, there are still a few ways to restructure debt. For example, deferred payments are always popular because they give relief to the borrower but preserves principal and interest for the bondholder.\n\nGovernment Funding\n\nWhen it comes to public projects, there is usually federal or state funding in the revenue mix -- reimbursements, set fees, grants and so forth. This is particularly true in health care providers and secondary school education, including charter schools. Dependent on government funding, there are generally limits on what the facility can charge or caps imposed on service payments. While the fairly steady revenue stream is initially attractive for creditors, the strictures it imposes in a workout quickly makes it a yoke.\n\nMoreover, with government funding almost inevitably comes regulatory structures, including reporting and audits to make sure projects comply with the rules. That is why higher education institutions, with government grants and federally funded student loan programs, fall into this category.\n\nProblems can emerge if the organization has not been well run or, worse, if there is financial malfeasance. With those government funds almost inevitably comes a first and prior lien securing them, priming whatever the bondholder may think their well-crafted bond documents secure for them. For example, with health care providers, Medicare and Medicaid \"claw-backs,\" which can occur even for the simplest of miscategorized filings, can rent asunder any workout between bondholders and borrower.\n\nIn higher education institutions, it's running afoul of Title 4 funding (federally backed student loan programs) that can force claw-backs. There are a host of reasons that can be invoked, but these days unacceptable student loan default rates are prime culprits. Moreover, when a college or university closes, all of their federal funding has to be accounted for. If the school has poor management and weak administrative controls, that becomes a very time consuming and unavoidable process -- which only drags out finding any solution.\n\nThe Upside: If the bondholders suspect financial wrong-doing or even simple incompetency on the part of the borrower in causing the default, federal and state overseers can be powerful allies in compelling information disclosure. While understandably wary of government intervention (the jokey nostrum \"we're from the government and here to help\" can be all too real), it is a valid cudgel to wield if a borrower is dragging its feet on releasing information. The borrower may see it as a bluff, knowing most bondholders don't want yet another stakeholder in the mix, but if a borrower is being particularly obstinate, the bondholders don't have much to lose given they won't get much by taking no action.\n\nLow Interest Rates\n\nAs any first year MBA learns, the cheaper the capital source, the higher the valuation. Think of it like a home mortgage. That $500,000 dream house that wasn't in your price range when mortgage rates were at 5% suddenly doesn't look so daunting at a 2% rate. Same thing with a new project financed by municipal bonds. It might not have worked at higher interest rates, but with the wave of a Harry Potter-esque magic wand of \"Lowerus Raterus,\" suddenly it becomes tenable.\n\nWell, tenable at least in spreadsheets and financial models. As the real-world kicks in, the magic fades and the borrower and bondholder alike come to discover a facility can be overleveraged just as much, if not more, with a lower interest rate as it can with a higher interest rate.\n\nThe workout problem in a low rate environment is that there isn't a lot of flexibility. When a bond defaults on paying an 8% coupon, reducing the coupon to 4% can mean a material difference on the income statement, giving some breathing room for operations. But in a low interest rate environment, there isn't much room to go if you are already near the floor. Negative rates aren't really an option.\n\nThat leaves the only other financial lever -- reducing, deferring or restructuring principal. The relationship between total debt service and principal reduction, regardless of the form it takes, is readily calculated. Whatever dollar-amount operations are needed for it to succeed, it's going to come out of principal.\n\nThe Upside: Even in a low-inflation environment, the future value of principal loses value with every passing year. For bondholders, better to give in on principal and preserve what really matters: tax-exempt income in hand now. It may be cold comfort, but at least the effective rate on the remaining restructured bonds is going to be higher than the rate on the initial financing -- and probably more accurately reflects the risk the bonds should have been valued at in the first place.\n\nSummary\n\nFor sure, Covid-19 is a \"black swan\" event, or at least one hopes so. But to dismiss it as once in a lifetime occurrence without learning some lessons would be foolish. No matter what the event, black swan, market or rate environment, the best protection against an unwanted financial outcome for both borrowers as builders and bondholders as lenders, is to have a clearly defined and quantified risk assessment methodology for project and investment, respectively. Be it a city council, nonprofit board, financial advisor or fund investment committee, this is the one strategy that continues to prove successful time and again in protecting the interests of all stakeholders. It is the core of being a fiduciary, to protecting and meeting the needs of clients, residents, patients, students or whatever community you are serving.", "uri": "6073477848", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/05/19/forewarned-is-forearmed-tips-and-pointers-for-municipal-bond-workouts/"}], "6073476360": [488982406, {"pk": 488982406, "name": "Sebi allows mutual funds to make additional investment in govt bonds", "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "text": "New Delhi: Markets regulator Sebi has permitted mutual funds to make additional investment in government securities and treasury bills for corporate bond, banking and public sector undertaking, and credit risk funds, industry sources said.\n\nThis comes following a request from industry body Amfi and fund houses seeking an increase in exposure of government securities in mutual fund schemes.\n\nIn a letter to Amfi, Sebi said asset management companies (AMCs) can invest an additional 15 per cent of assets under management (AUM) of corporate bond, banking and PSU and credit risk funds in government securities and treasury bills.\n\nIt, further, said that such additional investment in government securities and treasury bills is optional for mutual funds.\n\nThis has been allowed for a period of three months beginning Monday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said.\n\nAlso, the regulator has revised the scheme characteristic for corporate bond, banking and PSU and credit risk funds.\n\nSebi said corporate bond funds have to invest 65 per cent of total assets in AA+ and above-rated papers, while banking and PSU funds need to invest 65 per cent of the assets in debt instruments of banks, PSUs, public financial institutions and municipal bonds.\n\nCredit risk funds have to make a minimum investment of 50 per cent of assets in AA and below-rated papers, Sebi said.\n\nThis comes after Franklin Templeton MF shut its six debt schemes citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the debt market.\n\nPankaj Pathak, fund manager (fixed income) at Quantum Mutual Fund, said that except for government bonds and few AAA names, other segments of the bond market face liquidity problem in the secondary market.\n\n\"It is difficult to sell corporate bonds and create cash in case of large redemptions even in normal times.
